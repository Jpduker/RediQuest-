Nature Medicine published: Home-based transcranial direct current stimulation treatment for major depressive disorder: a fully remote phase 2 randomized sham-controlled trial,"My understanding:

So, **home based treatment** is where you don't have to go to a clinical setting for the treatment. 

**Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation** is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique which uses low levels of electrical current to alter the way neurons communicate with each other.

**Major depressive disorder** loosely is when one feels feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in activities.

**A fully remote phase 2 randomized sham-controlled trial** is study design involves randomly assigning participants to either receive active or a sham (placebo) treatment and conducting the entire trial online without requiring in-person visits.

~~

This was a **double blind** study, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was receiving the real and placebo treatments.

Everyone in the study was **at least 18 years old**.

Everyone in the study not only has **major depressive disorder**, but they also were in a **current depressive episode** of **at least moderate severity**. 

There was **174 participants** in the study, **120 were women** and **54 were men**.

These participants were divided evenly. 87 people received the Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and 87 received a placebo.

~~

There were ten weeks of at-home sessions. In the first three weeks, there were five sessions per week. Then in the seven remaining weeks, there were three sessions per week.

Each session lasted thirty minutes long. Electrodes were placed on the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 

The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plays a central role in mood regulation, decision making, and executive functions (like planning and impulse control). These are often disrupted in depression.

It is noteworthy that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex also plays a role in working memory and aspects of short term memory. Working memory is a type of short term memory (though separate from short term memory) which allows you to temporarily hold and manipulate information on your mind. A high functioning working memory may mean that you are good at solving math problems or following complicated directions.

~~

The active group used a 2 mA current and the placebo used no current, though, for them, the device powered up and down as if it was providing current.

**mA** stands for **milliampere**. An ampere is like a river of electricity while a milliampere is like a small stream branching off the river.

~~

The primary outcome was that, measured in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, there was a significant reduction in depressive symptoms for the active group compared with the placebo group.

Specifically, the active group improved 9.41 points, where the placebo group improved 7.14 points. 

The difference in improvement between the active and placebo groups was statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.012. This indicates that there is approximately a 1.2% chance of observing such extreme differences in improvement purely due to random variation if there were truly no effect of the treatment. In other words, the likelihood that these results occurred by chance is very low, suggesting a meaningful effect of the active treatment.

~~

Secondary outcomes were that people did not significantly discontinue participation in the study, indicating that the treatment is safe and well tolerated.

~~

It was concluded that Home-based tDCS under remote supervision was both effective and safe for treating depression.","Were subjects screened for prior tDCS? You can absolutely differentiate sham vs. active if you've experienced both. 2mA also seems quite low they could at least go with 3mA, possibly 4mA since it's a clinical population (though it's kinda uncomfortable).",other,NEGATIVE,0.9996165037155151

Hi everyone - So I have an undergraduate degree in Mass Communication with a concentration in Public Relations (PR), and I also have a masters degree in Human Resource Development with a concentration in Leadership Development. After almost a decade working in corporate PR (I’m 30 years old), I’m ready to make a bit of a career shift. Moving forward, I’d like to branch into consulting and focus on helping corporate professionals enhance their emotional intelligence. Why? Well we’ve all likely heard that EQ is often a better predictor of success than IQ, and I’ve seen that ring true time after time during my time in corporate. I’ve seen so many wickedly smart people get passed up for promotions, raises, or even fired simply because they have low EQ.

All that said, I’d like to start studying affective science to gain some knowledge and credibility in this space, but I don’t know where to start. 

* Do I need to go back to school to get my PhD? (This seems like it would give me the most credibility but I’m not thrilled about the idea of going back to school for 5+ years at my age)
* Can I learn and be credible simply by studying and reading on my own? 
* Any programs/online courses I should consider?

I’m 29 year old in my first year of being a Psychology student at the Open University in the UK. I got a BA in Maths in my early 20s. During that time I struggled a lot with mental health, family and financial issues that led me to work full time and therefore not having a good degree. I have been working as a software engineer for the past 8.5 years. 

I’m doing my bachelor’s in Psychology full time while working full time. My job is very flexible and I have a lot of determination. I’m expected to finish my degree in 3-4 years. Most of my time is composed of studying and work because I want to pursue my dream of an academic career in neuroscience. 

Currently at my university - being self taught and remote I have very limited opportunities.  Good references will be tough to get and I won’t have any opportunity to minor in neuroscience or in any way get involved in neuroscience at OU. Since the first year of university is very easy currently I am spending a lot of my time revisiting maths from my previous degree. I’m also planning on starting to study neuroscience books and lectures from November.  

I know that with a First Class Honours I might have a chance to get into a decent Masters neuroscience degree. However, that won’t be enough. I’m really interested in computational behaviour neuroscience and this is what I would like to pursue as my academic work. 

What my career path might look like:
29-33 years old: Bachelor’s degree in Psychology
33-34 y.o. : Masters in neuroscience with research focus
34-38/39 y.o. : PhD in computational /behaviour neuroscience
39+ y.o. : PostDoc position 

I’m very much aware that I have shot myself in the leg during the last 10 years. I’m also fully aware of what I’m giving up (security, free time, dating, social life, money, etc) and what I’m getting myself into.

My questions are:
Would this career path be realistic considering my background?
What can I do to improve my chances for getting into academia?

Put it all here.","I'm posting from the UK. I want to know if given all of this, a masters or a career in neuro research is plausible at all? 

I want to do a masters (to then do a PhD, and then end up in research) in neuroscience with a Philosophy with Psychology degree from the uni of Warwick and I don't know how realistic it is, because last year everything ever went wrong forever.

Essentially, the year weightings here are 0%, 50%, 50%. In first year (worth 0%) I got a first, things were good. Second year I got very ill and had to take a term out so couldn't complete my exams. Due to (largely) an admin_ error (plus some other things) I was forced to take a whole year out. They told me this apologetically over a call. Things really sucked because I had to work and survive and life became a bit grim. 

I was taking 2 third-year out-of-department modules (machine learning and neuroscience) as a second year and this didn't help. To put it simply my grades for second year - especially those modules - absolutely tanked. On the upside I published a paper (the topic is irrelevant to neuroscience though) and got invited to the royal society and got some research experience over the past 2 years, working with EEGs and BCIs and computational models... 

...and then my research partner terminated our project with no warning and no credit. 

 third year. Making up for my horrible second year grade is actually basically impossible (well, highly implausible). I'm expecting to get a high 2:1 at most. 

 year I can't take out of department modules which means everything is philosophy and psychology and not neuroscience. 

Back before everything went horribly wrong I emailed oxford neuro about whether phil+psych is even considered as a relevant degree and they actually urged me to apply. Now after the grade-tanking research-ending experience of last year I have no idea whether this is realistic at all; not just for Oxford but for any top uni. Or for any university at all. Oh, also I have no idea exactly precisely what I want to do in neuro, just the general vibe/area, despite wanting to go into a PhD after masters.

 And the deadline is 3rd December for the application. (Having an anxiety attack as we speak actually). Any insight or feedback or anything ever appreciated x",other,NEGATIVE,0.9993560910224915

I’m not sure which specific field I’d like to go into yet, but after shadowing a postdoc in a developmental psych lab, as well as doing my high school extended project on genetic and environmental factors influencing schizophrenia, I’m quite interested in basic research. As of now, I’m aiming to apply to grad school down the road, or just gain more experience in a research setting in general.

 Does anyone have any suggestions on how to build a portfolio of relevant experiences, or a timeline of when I should be doing shadowing/internship placements, to maximise my exposure to research?

In class, we’re being introduced to understanding/interpreting/critically reading research papers bit by bit, which I’m so excited to work on over time, but I’d still like to remain cognizant of developments in the neuroscience world as they’re happening, even if I can’t grasp the full technical details.

i would love to perform some quantitative cytological analyses on these slides but there is one major obstacle: the slices are mounted on literal windowpanes! the glass is simply too thick to fit into a slide scanner, and so there are no good ways to digitize the collection, save for manually photographing each tiny section through the eyepiece of a microscope that the host lab has modified to fit the windowpane slides...then in theory, uploading and sorting and reconstructing each slice like a puzzle... (i.e. it would be a herculean task)

thus i would appreciate any advice y'all could lend on this unusual scenario... what would you do? have you heard of any labs that process older archival slide sets like these, that are mounted on thick glass? is there any equipment that could accommodate this process? am i overlooking some other workaround?

Primate superior colliculus is causally engaged in abstract higher-order cognition,,"**Abstract**: The superior colliculus is an evolutionarily conserved midbrain region that is thought to mediate spatial orienting, including saccadic eye movements and covert spatial attention.

Here, we reveal a role for the superior colliculus in higher-order cognition, independent of its role in spatial orienting. We trained rhesus macaques to perform an abstract visual categorization task that involved neither instructed eye movements nor differences in covert attention.

We compared neural activity in the superior colliculus and the posterior parietal cortex, a region previously shown to causally contribute to abstract category decisions. The superior colliculus exhibits robust encoding of learned visual categories, which is stronger than in the posterior parietal cortex and arises at a similar latency in the two areas.

Moreover, inactivation of the superior colliculus markedly impaired animals’ category decisions. These results demonstrate that the primate superior colliculus mediates abstract, higher-order cognitive processes that have traditionally been attributed to the neocortex.

**Commentary**: This work has a couple of fairly significant findings.  First, it adds evidence that higher order cognitive function is driven bottom up from the brainstem, and a loss of brainstem functionality directly impairs function previously associated with neocortical areas.  As an example of the significance of this, it provides an alternate pathway for endophenotypes like ""ADHD"" being an artifact of brainstem function rather than ""deficits"" in cortical regions.

Second, it provides evidence that there are at least two distinct processing pathways, which operate at roughly the same latency and carry similar information.  This suggests that current state and past/future state are distinct processing streams, rather than the product of processing in any particular region.

As an aside, it's really unusual to see the word ""causal"" used in titles like this, but even more rare for work like this is seeing ""p = < .001"".  That's a pretty hard flex.

Global brain asymmetry and its variations in aging and related diseases (2024),,"# Abstract

Functional lateralization is a cardinal feature of human brain, and deviations from typical lateralization are observed in various brain disorders. Although this phenomenon has been widely acknowledged in the field of human neuroscience, decades of research have shown that it is a challenge to bridge the gap between (a)typically lateralized functions and hemispheric differences in structure (termed structural asymmetry). To address this important question, the present study employed the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to investigate the brain structural asymmetry and its associations with cognitive functions, aging, and aging-related diseases, by integrating large-scale datasets. Our proposed multivariate approach revealed previously unknown and substantial structural differences between the left and right hemispheres, and established the associations between the global brain asymmetry and lateralized functions including hand motor and emotion processing. Furthermore, at the population level we mapped the aging trajectories of the global brain asymmetry, and unveiled significant diagnosis-specific variations in patients with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and individuals carrying a relevant genetic risk for atypical brain aging (i.e., APOE4 carriers). These results demonstrated left-hemisphere-linked changes in aging, which has challenged the traditional ""right hemi-aging"" model, and offered a promising approach for assessing brain aging and related diseases. Overall, our study with a novel approach presents one of the largest-scale investigation of global brain asymmetry, and takes an important step forward in understanding the intricate interplay between structural asymmetry, lateralized functions, and brain aging in health and disease.",other,POSITIVE,0.9958015084266663

Can you guys give me any tips or websites which could possibly help me with my neuroscience journey? Thanks :)","This is great to see. I have a master's in neuroscience, so I'll give you some insights. I've always been interested in the brain in particular dementia and Alzheimer's Disease. A typical path to be a neuroscientist is gradaute school. I've seen many Neuroscience majors for undergrad and it basically is providing the core knowledge. A neuroscientist does research. 

You hear the misconception ""We only use 10% of our brain""? Well that was misunderstood from ""we only know about 10% of our brain"". And it still true, we BARELY know about the brain meaning there is A LOT to study and learn. 

You're just in high school, so you still have lots of time. Go to university and take a neuroscience major (sometimes they fall under biology major with neuroscience subspecialty). If you want to start studying the core knowledge, go check out Coursera and look up ""Medical Neuroscience"". I used that course for my first year neuroscience masters course. He provides notes you can use. 

What is it to be a neuroscientist?... There are lots of fields. Cognitive, systems, molecular, behavioral, and computational are the most common fields and each generally utilizes different methods to research the brain.. but these days, we need to collaborate each field to produce a more comprehensive story for our work. However, what is common for all neuroscience these days are statistics and computation/coding. We are able to collect LOTS of data these days and you need coding/computation (to find the best way to filter or clean the data) and statistics (to find the best way to interpret the data) knowledge. 

Let me tell you a con of being a neuroscientist and that is... its not a lucrative field. So much work we do (typically in animals) do not translate to humans well. I work on mice to find Alzheimer's treatment, but when I present results to doctors, they reply...
""So you found that this particular receptor CAN be a target for treatment... but what else? Can you produce a drug to target it? If so when can you start clinical trials?""
This makes neuroscience a field that requires lots of funding (to do research), but the payout is usually low. You really need to have passion without monetary incentives to be a good neuroscientist.

Anyway, after studying the brain a bit and there's a subject you're interested, shoot me a message and I might be able to send you extra reading material. I specialize in learning and memory in addition to dementia. Good luck and stay passionate!",interest_in_research,NEGATIVE,0.9971016645431519

A prescription for a psycho stimulant, a diagnosis of ADHD, and a sense of dumbfoundedness when I realized how drastically that tiny white pill changed my thinking/ behavior sparked a lifelong pursuit into untangling the distinction between brain, behavior, and disorder.

Assuming you’re also a passionate young mind with a thirst for knowledge, I’d recommend focusing on one aspect that makes sense to you coherently.

You’re still a kid, so a lot of the information you come across won’t be digestible at first. Explore a few different topics, and see which one makes the most sense to you. I started with psychopharmacology because I took nearly every class of psychiatric drug available and grew up around substance abuse. So it all was easy to connect the dots and build up a fundamental understanding of brain function from the ground up.

By age 17, I could have academic conversation with people here on Reddit about various theories of psychopathology.

During my teen years, psychedelic research and trans diagnostic perspectives started becoming mainstream, so I was immersed in a lot of literature explaining psychiatric diseases more generally and many considered symptom presentations largely interchangeable amongst different disorders,  and many different theories of pathology were explained in a trans diagnostic lens. 

It was an exciting time for the cognitive sciences. We had been chasing our tails for thirty or so years after psychiatric drugs became standard practice in medicine and out theories of pathology were centered around their mechanisms of action.

Given that I was a psychiatric patient myself, I could understand all the information in lectures, papers, and textbooks/ seminars very intuitively.

By the time you start college, machine learning and computational theories of cognition will be utilized more heavily.

So a good place to look may be with something called predictive coding/ active inference.

Non cortical structures are being more closely linked to cognition as a whole. 

It’s an exciting time to get involved and immerse yourself kiddo, and your best shot at cultivating a passion is identifying some sub field/ topic which you can understand without expending too much energy as to avoid burn out.

Then your understanding will naturally progress to more general and advanced topics.

Lastly, my most important piece of advice is to not neglect your other intellectual interests and don’t neglect your current course work.

The interesting brain stuff will always be here, we have a long ways to go. Explore your interests, but do good in your general studies and enjoy being a kid.

Utilize your current passions/ interest to identify a sub field/ topic that can easily introduce you into neuroscience.

You won’t get it all at first, you’ll come across info that doesn’t make sense, and that’s ok. You’ll find that if you have a genuine desire to learn, people a whole lot smarter/ wiser than you will be glad to give you insight into the burning questions you have. I’ve spoken with well renowned neuroscientists, physicists, and neuropsychologists. 

That all came around age 18 and during my early college experiences, I’m 21 now.

For now, do well In school, build a support system, and identify a passion or interest that fits in well with your current interests.

I was lucky to have been able to have found a sub field of neuroscience that made intuitive sense to me due to my experiences, but it may be more difficult for you.

You have the advantage of your mind being far more malleable. So identifying these things early on will make you well prepared for college and put you ahead of your peers, but something I wish I didn’t do was neglect my more general studies due to my hyper fixation on these interests.

Being well versed in the various fields of the cognitive sciences and having a solid understanding of some fundamental theories of cognition doesn’t mean shit if you can’t efficiently do basic calculus..

So do well in school, and identify something that fits in with your current interests and build a foundational understanding from there, and you’ll be leagues ahead of your peers. Just don’t neglect all the boring and mundane because you were watching lectures and reading papers instead of doing algebra homework.

You have a bright future kiddo, good luck and never let your curiosity die out!",other,POSITIVE,0.9886633455753326
Looking for a silver staining protocol,"Hi there,  


Does anyone know some suitable protocols for doing a simple silver staining of neurons?   
  
I'm not a neuroscientist—I'm working on a project in developmental biology, where we are trying to visualise the nervous system of a species of soft coral (Xenia sp.), so I haven't worked with neurons much before. I've been trying antibody staining for a few weeks with mixed success, and a friend of mine recommended I try a silver-staining protocol.  
  
Does anyone know some tried-and-tested protocols they have used themselves?

I looked up a couple of things online and found some protocols, but I noticed most of them recommend taking thin sections of the sample. I hope to stain whole coral polyps rather than sections (about 1-5 mm in length and about 1 mm in diameter).   
  
Would this make a difference in which protocol I use if I want to avoid taking sections?

And do I need to find a silver-staining method that is specific to cnidarians (corals and jellyfishes), or are the methods typically applicable to a broad range of species?

Thanks :)

Help with Over-Staining of cFos Immunofluorescence,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working on labeling cFos in the auditory cortex using immunofluorescence, but I’m running into issues with non-specific binding. A few months ago, I struggled to get any cFos staining on my tissue, so I was advised to use antigen retrieval and bake the slides at 60°C for 2-4 hours. Here’s the protocol I’ve been following:

1. **Bake at 60°C for 4 hours.**
2. **Wash** with 1X PBS (pH 7.2) 6 times for 5 minutes each.
3. **Antigen retrieval:** Microwave in sodium citrate for 10 minutes, rest for 30 minutes, repeat with another 10 minutes of microwaving, then rest for 30 minutes before washing.
4. **Wash** 3 times in 1X PBS for 15 minutes.
5. **Blocking step** for 30 minutes.
6. **Wash** 3 times for 15 minutes in 1X PBS.
7. **Incubate** with cFos (E-8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:20 concentration (recommended is 1:50) with conjugated Alexa Fluor 594. Recommended incubation is 90 minutes, but I incubate overnight at 4°C.
8. **Wash** with 1X PBS for 15 minutes, 3 times.
9. **Mount** with Diamond Antifade with DAPI and cure for 24 hours.

My current issue is that I’m getting non-specific binding across the entire brain. My target is the striatum, and I expect very specific binding in the auditory cortex, but instead, I’m seeing over-staining everywhere. My tissue is fixed frozen on slides with PFA/Sucrose fixative. I’ve gone from no staining to too much staining and need to find a middle ground.

Does anyone have suggestions for minimizing this over-staining? Should I adjust the incubation time, concentration, reduce the antigen retrieval to just 1 microwave, maybe bake for 2 hours instead of 4?

Patch Clamp in Dissociate Rat Cultures?,"Later this week I will be doing some voltage clamp recordings in dissociated rat cultures, which I have no experience working with. This is part of a collaboration between my current lab and another, and was on relatively short notice. Most of my previous recordings have done have been in vitro slice recordings of mice, so I am unsure how the cells will respond to our ACSF once put into the bath. The current media the cultures are being incubated in has an osmolality of around 225 mOsm/kg, while our ACSF is in the range of 300 - 310 mOsm/kg. Is this a big enough difference to cause the cells to go into shock once they go from the bath to the ACSF? Is there an optimal way to slowly bring the cells up, or is ok to just put them and allow them to adjust? The papers I've found that record from dissociated cultures don't provide very thorough methods in regards to the ACSF, so any help in this regard would be nice.

Concentration Gradients and Neurons ,"Hello Neuroscience Community! I have never posted before, so hopefully this is the correct place to ask this question. 

So, earlier today, I was reading a biochemistry textbook (the full-length Voet & Voet book) and I was reading up on electrochemical cells, gradients, and how they are used in the electron transport chain. I took biochemistry a little over a year ago now, and although I got the gist, I never understood WHY the proton gradient produced ATP. So today, as I was reading, the book stated that the reason for this is due to the kinetics of the proton gradient (and other concentration gradients). It said that it takes a large amount of energy to create and maintain this proton gradient (which is very low in entropy), so the discharge of it (which I assumed to mean a breakdown of the gradient into a collection of other ions) releases a lot of energy (as it is increasing in entropy). If I’m not mistaken, this is a similar concept to how ATP itself is such a high-energy molecule - it takes a significant amount of energy to keep these phosphate groups together, so the hydrolysis of these bonds releases a lot of energy. 

My question, then, comes to neurons. Of course, neurons have a concentration gradient that requires energy to create (the sodium-potassium ATPase). This concentration gradient, though, is broken down when sodium comes into the cell and potassium leaves (as occurs during an action potential). So, again, we are going from a concentration gradient that is low in entropy to a discharging of the gradient which is higher in entropy? Assuming this is true, there would be a discharge of energy? If so, is it this energy that drives action potentials? Are action potentials naturally spontaneous and don’t require a source of energy? Is this potential energy used elsewhere? Any direction, information, or resources I can look to would be greatly appreciated.

For some context, I am a fourth year student set on graduating from the University of Toronto, and so I am not as familiar with the process in the US as things take on a bit of a different route here. My research interest in a nutshell is: using neuroimaging (PET, fMRI) to look at psychiatric disorders (mainly substance use and mood disorders). First off, I have been finding it quite difficult to locate which institutions and which programs would match this research interest (is it Neuroscience? Psychology? Translational Medicine?) due to my lack of exposure to US schools. As an example, in UofT it would be referred to as the Institute of Medical Sciences.

  
It is also important to note that I am an international student from Indonesia, and so I was wondering if there was a difference between funding for MSc/direct-entry PhD when it comes to international students. I have a decent enough GPA but my main show would be my 3 years of research experience in the clinical psychiatry field, and so I think I have a decent shot at direct-entry (that is my plan for Canadian universities).

In my experience, either you have a knack for it and you thrive, or you don't, and the barrier to entry is impossible.

I want to make sure your sights are set on something attainable. It's a similar discipline to physics, in that, liking physics doesn't make one a potential physicist. You need at least a base level of a knack for intrinsically understanding what you are looking at when you see neurology. Not a picture of a brain, but a science with concrete and provable, replicable outcomes.

Immunology has absolutely nothing in common with neuroscience as far as I know. Neuroscience isn't even really a medical field.

I could really use any help, suggestions or directions in search for relevant literature.

I struggle in school because of attention/motivation/executive function problems growing up with constant negative reinforcement and having ADHD. But because of that, it's my inspiration for pursuing this path and with the goal to help others that struggle as I do with no great solution.

I am very fond of the sciences and the topics fascinate me, and quite passionate for biological sciences, and various topics of physics and chemistry and most of all how they all tie into each other within the human experience.

Though I have lots of interest in these topics, learning and more-so applying knowledge still proves to be a challenge especially within physics and chemistry. I've just about always been regarded as smart, and I credit that to how I can obtain vast knowledge on specifics that I take lots of interest in, but things I don't find as interesting or even 'boring' makes it so much more difficult. But, biological concepts and topics still prove to be no issue for me.

I am interested in going into university for neuroscience but there are lots of feelings of self doubt and anxiety regarding my success in doing so. Any advice? 

What is learning neuroscience at a university level like? Is it hard to keep up? And if anyone can relate, please share your experience. Thank you !!",other,POSITIVE,0.6766126155853271

I’d love to be getting to design my own studies to do research at the intersection of many of these things, writing about the findings, and maybe doing advocacy based on the findings. Although i have a hard time imagining i’d actually like doing the technical work in a lab day in and day out (though i really dont know), and i’m not a writer. I also know I'd like working with people as a therapist (ive had great experiences doing kind of similar work), but i feel a little more pulled towards the impact of research, writing, education and advocacy. 



 Historically i’ve been much more satisfied with jobs that let me have satisfying interpersonal work (working with kids at a montessori school; doing somatics - body focused emotional healing stuff one on one with clients) or creative problem solving & physical movement like carpentry. 



Obviously i could just become a therapist and specialize in some of the stuff i’m interested in…and i think I’d be pretty happy doing that, although doing the business side of that job and all the paperwork required to deal with insurance and stay compliant sounds…not fun. But I’d also love to be contributing to the type of work that people like Gabor Mate do - studying and writing about the connection between peoples emotional environments in childhood, disease, and social conditions. But i have no idea how to get into that type of work, or what those jobs would even be. Also I’m pretty anti grind culture. I’ve always felt like life isnt about work and had no interest in landing in some career with long hours, high stress, and little flexibility in schedule / hours.

Are there any 3D probes on the market? (Like a Utah Array-Neuropixel crossover),"I'm a Neuro grad student/research tech working in higher-order visual processing. My PI is very interested in laminar processing/circuits, so he wants to use Neuropixel probes. However, that leaves out the dimension parallel to the cortical surface, which is definitely also important given the organization of neurons and their receptive fields. A Utah Array would capture that parallel dimension, but then we'd lose the laminar (perpendicular) dimension. 

  
I'm wondering if there is some sort of probe that is a cross-over. I'm thinking along the lines of a Utah Array, but each probe is like a Neuropixel probe. Obviously that exact design wouldn't be feasible given the massive amount of channels, and increased size of a Neuropixel compared to a single Utah electrode (it would just turn that brain region to mush). But I'm wondering if there is some sort of compromise between the two?

What are the current pros and cons of a MS vs a PhD? ,"I'm currently entering my undergrad with the goal of working in research and academia long term. Base on what I've read so far it seems that without a PhD your career can plateau. 

Has anyone had any success with a MS in Neuroscience?

I'm really interested in the Brain Institute at DARPA. I have a military background so I would hope that would help with applications to government research work.

Ultimately with my benefits I do get living expense stipends for 8 years in the presuit of my education so that will help me gain education and avoid debt in the process of my presuit.

I'd be open to working for a time period after a MS before returning to school to persue a PhD.

Does anyone have any experience on the pros and cons? ","I presume you are from the states and there MS is becoming less commonly an entry degree for PhD. US PhD programs value research experience more than anything else, and having a MS degree with 1/2 more years of coursework is not going to help a lot. Instead, more and more students work as post-baccalaureate research associates/lab managers after they graduate to accumulate more research experience for grad school. You can earn a (\~poverty line but OK) salary while you gain full-time research experience, a strong recommendation letter, and potentially nice papers. So if a PhD is your desired terminal degree, please consider RA/LM positions.

MS on the other hand is more oriented for professionals, and that's why there are fewer master programs in neuroscience than in bioinformatics, biomedical engineering, or computer science (which are better-looking titles to have when hunting for a job). Of course MS is perfect if you do want to join the workforce but just be aware you might not be able to be work on R&D with an MS.

Another scenario where doing an MS could be helpful is when your undergrad is not in a neuroscience-related field. Then a MS would be nice as you can take courses that complement your background. Several of my friends did this when they were switching from another field (e.g. architecture or philosophy).",other,NEGATIVE,0.9968326687812805

Hypothetically, the human brain grew large when hunte[REDACTED] humans gave way to collectivist humans who live as intermingling societies. The size was for social communication and the very nuanced thing that is human interaction.

Basically. And yes I do have some credentials so this isn't simply a guess from some nobody. The brain growth was evolution. The evolution from an Individualist species, to a Collectivist species.

Acting, to interacting. Massive, massive neurological growth required to get from A to B and the reasoning as far as I can tell would not be anything as simple as what is proposed in this article. That brain size and space is not superfluous or accidental, it is physical evolution.

There is no such part of the human brain that just puffs up, comma, does nothing. All of it is for something.

However, UCSC is willing to take all her community college credits unlike the other UCs (she has >70 units and two AA degrees when she graduated from high school a few days ago).

I learned molecular techniques, microscopy, primary cell culture, electrophysiology, etc. 

Before graduating, my spouse got a job in an area that didn’t have a lot of opportunity for me so I switched to medical writing. We’ve talked about moving to an area that I know has a large pharmaceutical presence. Since, it’s been one year since I’ve been away from the bench, am I competitive for pharmaceutical positions or am I too late? I didn’t do a post doc because of the poor pay, and I was offered this remote job that pays 30k more than any post doc was offering.

Brain-inhabiting bacteria and neurodegenerative diseases: the “brain microbiome” theory (2023),,"Abstract:

Controversies surrounding the validity of the toxic proteinopathy theory  
 of Alzheimer’s disease have led the scientific community to seek   
alternative theories in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders   
(ND). Recent studies have provided evidence of a microbiome in the   
central nervous system. Some have hypothesized that brain-inhabiting   
organisms induce chronic neuroinflammation, leading to the development   
of a spectrum of NDs. Bacteria such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, and Cutibacterium acnes have been found to inhabit the brains of ND patients. Furthermore, several fungi, including Candida and Malassezia  
 species, have been identified in the central nervous system of these   
patients. However, there remains several limitations to the brain   
microbiome hypothesis. Varying results across the literature, concerns   
regarding sample contamination, and the presence of exogenous   
deoxyribonucleic acids have led to doubts about the hypothesis. These   
results provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis of NDs. Herein,   
we provide a review of the evidence for and against the brain microbiome  
 theory and describe the difficulties facing the hypothesis.   
Additionally, we define possible mechanisms of bacterial invasion of the  
 brain and organism-related neurodegeneration in NDs and the potential   
therapeutic premises of this theory.",other,NEGATIVE,0.8987098336219788

"In experiments in mice, the most anxious individuals sought out stimulation of certain neurons that both induce extreme hunger and quiet anxiety. The findings suggest a biological basis for restricting food to the point of starvation, seeking anorexia-like behaviors to relieve stress.",,"A neuroscience-based approach suggests that individuals with high stress/anxiety may seek out further anxiety/stress-inducing behaviors due to:

1. *Maladaptive coping mechanisms*: Stress and anxiety can lead to impulsive decisions and seeking temporary escapes or relief through behaviors like substance abuse or compulsive gambling.

2. *Dysregulated reward system*: Chronic stress can alter the brain's reward system, leading to a craving for intense experiences or thrill-seeking behaviors that temporarily distract from negative emotions.

3. *Hyperarousal*: Stress and anxiety can create a state of hyperarousal, making individuals more susceptible to seeking out stimulating activities or environments that match their elevated emotional state.

4. *Social connections*: Stress and anxiety can lead to seeking social support through shared experiences, even if those experiences are stressful or anxiety-provoking.

5. *Learned behavior*: Trauma or past experiences can condition individuals to associate stress and anxiety with a sense of control or familiarity, leading them to seek out similar situations.

6. *Neuroplasticity*: Repeated exposure to stress and anxiety can rewire the brain, creating a preference for familiar emotional states, even if they're negative.

7. *Self-medication*: Stress and anxiety can lead to seeking out substances or behaviors as a form of self-medication to temporarily alleviate symptoms.

8. *Lack of emotional regulation*: Difficulty managing emotions can lead individuals to seek out intense experiences as a way to cope with overwhelming feelings.

Put it all here.","I graduated in 2022 with a bachelor's in computer science. I have spent a good portion of my free-time reading ML papers related to the work I do, but I have not implemented any, nor have I had the chance to make use of them at work (aside from improving my technical vocabulary, I guess).

I am looking to earn a Computational Neuroscience / Machine learning PhD (e.g. [UCL's Computational Neuroscience PhD](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/research-degrees/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit-mphil-phd)). I am especially interested in cybernetic approaches to understanding cognition, like Predictive Processing or Friston's more generalized Active Inference. Except for my high school background, I have no experience with biology, chemistry, or physics.

I am laying out and working through a course of self-study on my [GitHub](https://github.com/blolt/Learning), which is so far focused on mathematics, probability, and machine learning. I would deeply appreciate recommendations on how I can extend this repository with neuroscience resources. I am lately reading Phillip Ball's, ""How Life Works,"" which has left me with a negative impression of much of the life sciences, particularly from the latter century. This has left me uncertain on where I should turn for proper self-study of biology. I'd appreciate advice on which textbooks/courses/lecture series to turn to for self-studying neuroscience.

I have also applied to neuroscience research labs at universities in need of engineers / data scientists. Most of those applications are still out, but I personally feel they are long-shots. The idea is that if I can get a position at a university, I can gain practical experience while taking free or reduced tuition courses to shore up my academic background. I'd appreciate recommendations on how to look for jobs in the field as a software engineer.

Most of the researchers I am interested in working with are at extremely prestigious schools, which is making me think that I should pursue a Master's degree first. I have also considered a pre-med post-bacc, since these would cover many of the necessary prerequisites. Would love to hear suggestions on the best course of action to pursue for formal study.

TL;DR  
I am asking for

1. Resources for self-study of neuroscience (assuming relevant physics, mathematics, and computer science background is completed to a high degree).
2. Advice on how to get a job as a software engineer / data scientist that will get me practical experience working on neuroscience-related problems, particularly from a machine learning perspective.
3. Suggestions on degrees/certifications to pursue prior to applying for PhD programs at top institutions.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9797190725803375

Plastic vasomotion entrainment,,"Horizontally oscillating stripe pattern at 0.25 Hz caused a reaction in the mouse's blood vessels that matched the pattern's speed. Mice were presented with 15-minute visual training sessions interleaved with 1-hour resting periods for 4 times per day. With such spaced training, the amplitude of the synchronized vasomotion gradually increased, which spread throughout the whole brain.

While it's long been known that changes in neuron connections support learning and memory, the plasticity of vasomotion hasn't been described before. Such enhancement of circulation mechanisms may benefit the information processing capacity of the brain.

The next step is to explore the advantages of vasomotion synchronization. It might help clear waste like amyloid beta, potentially delaying or preventing dementia. Additionally, synchronized vasomotion might even enhance intelligence beyond our natural capabilities.

large sample (90) is really (mathematically) very small.

.23 may be statistically significant, but it's a very weak positive correlation.

More likely:   brains are much the same regardless of political orientation.

Left and Right are certainly all slaves to their dopaminergic processes.

So ...

I give you a:  'probably wrong'.

Then again, there could be small 'transient' effects related to orientation.

e.g.

Being 'highly conservative' ON A 'highly liberal' campus, or vice versa.

i.e.

'We found that increased gray matter volume in the right amygdala was significantly associated with conservatism ([Figure 1](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(11)00289-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982211002892%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#gr1)B) (R = 0.23)'

But you have no corresponding opposite finding for liberalism.

Ergo - maybe you're not measuring 'orientation', so much as 'having the wrong orientation' for the environment.

(e.g. adaptation to a hostile or 'ego-dystonic' environment)

I kind of suspect if you did a similar study in a highly conservative environment ... the highly liberal group might look the same.

Despite the brain hemispheres not being connected by the corpus callosum, they still observed coordinated activity between the hemispheres at rest. They state that this shows that the brain networks that are active at rest are not altered by severing the corpus callosum and state ""Thus, we propose that we have separate systems in the brain that generate distributed conscious.

Looking for SOTA paper on predictive models using electrophysiology measurements.,"Hello everyone,

As the title suggests, I am looking for papers on deep learning models for predicting animal state and behaviors using electrophysiology measurements. I am particularly interested in predicting socio-emotional state (tendency to express social behaviors) but it doesn't really matter.

For context, I am a phd student, with a dataset of electrophysiology measurements recorded while the animals (rats) performed social interaction tests. I want to build a model that can use the measurements to predict the animal sociability and predict if they are going to perform social investigation.

My approach to far is to use one of the following:

1. Add cross attention to wav2vec so that it will work multi-signals (and not a single vector)
2. Use videoMAE , similar idea to wav2vec, convert signal to sepctrogram images, and have a multi-channel input

Looking for SOTA paper on predictive models using electrophysiology measurements.,"Hello everyone,

As the title suggests, I am looking for papers on deep learning models for predicting animal state and behaviors using electrophysiology measurements. I am particularly interested in predicting socio-emotional state (tendency to express social behaviors) but it doesn't really matter.

For context, I am a phd student, with a dataset of electrophysiology measurements recorded while the animals (rats) performed social interaction tests. I want to build a model that can use the measurements to predict the animal sociability and predict if they are going to perform social investigation.

My approach to far is to use one of the following:

1. Add cross attention to wav2vec so that it will work multi-signals (and not a single vector)
2. Use videoMAE , similar idea to wav2vec, convert signal to sepctrogram images, and have a multi-channel input
3. Use this recent paper: Unified Training of Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformers [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02592.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02592.pdf)   


Any thoughts? ideas? ","I’m sorry but there are too many questions to provide any help!

Which electrophysiology measurements do you have? I’m assuming ECoG if posting on a neuroscience forum and working with an animal model.

Why and how exactly do you plan to use speech recognition (wav2vec) or video masking software on rat electrophysiological data?

Why do you say “it doesn’t really matter”? 

What is SOTA?

I am also doing a PhD using EEG with a focus on developing predictive models and I’ve never been this confused",other,NEGATIVE,0.9995498061180115

[This got taken down from [REDACTED] so I'll try here]

Hey all, I'll try to keep this short.

I'm interested in what people's oppinions/advices are for someone in the position I described above. 

I'm set to graduate with a BA in ""Media Arts and Sciences"" from Arizona State. Its a mixed bag of degree with a lot of different paths to have taken. I used it to learn the basics of computer coding, get some certs related to data analytics, and take some fun philosophy/history of technology classes. And one class all about AI and theory of mind that was my absolute favorite class I've ever taken. Coming to the end of it now I can't say that I'm too happy with where I'm at vs. where I wanna be though.

To keep it short. I didn't pick the degree because it was my calling or anything. I just picked it because I felt a bit rushed into the decision at the time and lacked the self-confidence to pick anything that called to me and truthfully I never really knew what I wanted to do in the first place. College has been a bit of an adventure to me. I was studying linguistics for a while then dropped out to transition (I'm trans) and recover my mental health. Two years later I enrolled in a different uni via a program through my job and started on the degree mentioned at the top.

Now here I am trying to figure out where to go from here. I have a degree that doesn't really excite me or relate to anything I wanna do. I have no debt from school though, so there's  that at least. 

Now, having had the last few years to grow up and learn about myself, finishing my degree up, happily transitioned, 5 months sober, etc. etc. I finally figured out what I want to do and why!

I want to go into neuroscience. I love love love reading about it. I have a long standing curiosity about the human mind, philosophy of mind, the mechanisms of mental health and human experience, etc. I also like to think that pursuing study in the field will allow me to go into the mental health field. I've benefitted massively from some really great mental health care in life, and I would thrilled to be able to ""return the favor"" so to speak by being able to help others by going into counseling and studying mental illness. 

So how can I do this? Starting a new bachelor's sounds like the wrong way to do it, but there's no way I can get into a master's program with the degree I've got. I've got a good GPA at 3.7, but that about all I've got going for me. I feel stuck and I don't know what to do.

Has anybody been here before?

Edit:
I didn't mention it, but I'm 27. So I feel really pressured to get a sense of where I'm going with all this. I already feel so behind all my peers who seemed to have all finished uni 5 years ago.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9963076710700989
How to explain a reverse pattern between activation and correlation in fMRI research?," 

Hi experts,

In my fMRI experiment, two conditions were compared: a high disgust condition and a low disgust condition. The high disgust condition involved presenting participants with disgusting images, while the low disgust condition presented the same images but with the disgusting elements digitally removed. During fMRI scanning, participants passively viewed stimuli from both conditions. After scanning, participants rated the level of disgust for each set of stimuli on a scale of 0 to 10.

Three results were observed:

1. The disgust ratings for the high disgust condition were significantly higher than those for the low disgust condition, with ratings close to 10 for the high disgust condition and close to 0 for the low disgust condition.
2. Beta values in a specific brain region were significantly higher (t-test) for the low disgust condition than for the high disgust condition, consistent with existing references indicating a response to this type of digital image processing.
3. When examining the relationship (Pearson correlation) between the difference in activation (beta values: high disgust condition - low disgust condition) of this region and the difference in ratings (high disgust condition rating - low disgust condition rating) across all participants, a significant positive correlation was found. Almost all activation differences were negative, while rating differences were positive.

On one hand, from the perspective of activation, this brain region appears to respond more strongly to the low disgust condition. On the other hand, from a correlation standpoint, it exhibits the opposite effect.

How can these results be interpreted?

Thank you!","""People find different things disgusting and appealing based on a combination of socialization and past experiences but with vague implications that an inborn sense of revulsion and comfort may in fact exist within the human race based on demonstrable but yet unknown factors pertaining to:

Texture. Taste. Color. Smell. Etc.""

Remember that what images really do is evoke sensory memory. It's not merely a picture of something gross or nice. It is EVOCATIVE. 

Are you accounting for that? Or is it strictly being viewed internally as gross pictures?

Are you considering that a picture of something the participant knows smells disgusting is evocative within their olfactory, the same as if the smell itself were present?

What about, gross texture? Are your readings being interpreted as how the picture LOOKS? Or, how the participant knows that texture to FEEL?

Remember that neuroscience is every single part of the human experience. Not just random brain signals but the way sandpaper feels rubbing against our skin is stored there too as sense memory.

How nuanced is your take on these images?  

If this is just about reacting to pictures you are casting your net way too shallow and won't find anything.

Remember that sensory memory is still memory and memory goes where, exactly?

The brain. Neurology. Neuroscience.

That is the shorthand version of what I would say is being suggested by your research.

Sensory memory is stored in and accessed from the neurological network. This is sort of widely known, but also, narrowly researched. Ample opportunity for further research and honestly? This is a study that if broadened and sharpened, has real potential.

However to me it sounds more like a research(ed) proposal and less like completed work. Keep at it. I know it's discouraging to hear you aren't done with whatever this is by a long shot, but, it should be very encouraging to hear that it could be the beginning of meaningful work! Meaningful work in an area where few of us are actively exploring.

Sensory memory and its place within the neurological framework. A wide open sandbox with infinite possibilities because while many know it's there, few have done anything meaningful with it yet.

I only have nominal experience with non e-phys techniques like gels, Western blots, any form of imaging, etc. I've had two post-docs that didn't result in publications because my situation changed (first time was a bad culture fit in another country, second was pandemic + personal medical issues), and now it's too long ago for me to even consider another post-doc. 

This has made it basically impossible to find a job. I'm not against going back to school, but for what? I taught myself to code in Python and have been doing some basic machine learning courses and whatnot, but since my passion is actually neuroscience I'd like to stay in this realm. I was hoping to find a Master's program in computational neuroscience since I have some experience coding for an EEG startup, but I'm not sure if that would encompass coding and EEGs while still being somewhat relevant with my e-phys training.

And here's the killer part--I can't move. I'm stuck in Montreal, Quebec where I was told lots of biopharma companies exist, but apparently that was around a decade ago that they peaked, and now it's a ton of AI work. While I do have some experience with AI from getting a certificate in machine learning/data science, I don't have anywhere near the experience needed to compete with fresh college graduates on top of the flood of more experienced people coming from what seems to be near constant layoffs. Plus I never wanted to actually become a developer, the coding was intended to supplement neuroscience research that I wanted to return to after recovering from my medical issues.

So here I am, working as a grocery clerk so I don't end up homeless, wondering what I could possibly go back to school for to give myself a leg up. I have my PhD in neuro plus the certificate, and I still can't seem to find anything. Any suggestions?",other,NEGATIVE,0.9980195760726929

Question regarding the GHK equation,"  

https://preview.redd.it/zugj5pl2xclc1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e9332d8e131878cf95560550a0d4b506957806d

Lets suppose we were to use the GHK equation to compare the resting potential of two neurons: A and B, such that B has a higher intracellular concentration of  K+ than A and all the other concentrations in the formula are the same for both neurons. I understand how mathematically the formula plays out to result in a lower resting potential for B than for A, but I don’t get how this happens virtually. How can the resting potential for B be lower than A if B has more intracellular positive charge? I know increasing the intracellular concentration makes more íons leave the cell, but the vast majority stays inside. Should I assume B has also a greater intracellular concentration of a non-permeable anion, making both the inside and outside of the neuron initially neutral? This is the only explanation that makes sense to me, since it would allow a small flow of K+ out of the cell to decrease the potential by accumulating positive charge on the outside while leaving excess of negative charge provided by that anion on the inside.

So, is this assumption correct? Thanks in advance and sorry for any language mistakes.","In order to maintain a high-quality subreddit, the /[REDACTED] moderator team manually reviews all text post and link submissions that are not from academic sources (e.g. nature.com, cell.com, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

My only gripe about modern neuroscience (especially cognitive and behavioral) is the major and widespread assumption that human behavior can be quantified via ""this brain area leads to this type of behavior, thus, we think this is what causes ___disorder"".

The brain is non linear in functioning, and the brain and body should be considered a two way feedback system.

The brain shouldn't be segmented so specifically when trying to explain human behavior, but I feel like we should be explaining behavior from the perspective of whole brain functioning, and trying to quantify disruptions in behavior in terms of ""specfic dysfunction of this type of behavioral/ cognitive process can be explained through x y and z mechanisms, here are some features unique to __ cognitive phenotypes"".

I know the pharmaceutical industry wants novel drug targets, but damn, it seems like we've been chasing our tails looking for specific abnormalities in specific brain areas for 30+ years. Different theories aren't inherently ""wrong"" or ""right"".

Summary

Background
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proposed as a feasible treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). However, meta-analytic evidence is heterogenous and data from multicentre trials are scarce. We aimed to assess the efficacy of tDCS versus sham stimulation as an additional treatment to a stable dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in adults with MDD.

Methods
The DepressionDC trial was triple-blind, randomised, and sham-controlled and conducted at eight hospitals in Germany. Patients being treated at a participating hospital aged 18–65 years were eligible if they had a diagnosis of MDD, a score of at least 15 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (21-item version), no response to at least one antidepressant trial in their current depressive episode, and treatment with an SSRI at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before inclusion; the SSRI was continued at the same dose during stimulation. Patients were allocated (1:1) by fixed-blocked randomisation to receive either 30 min of 2 mA bifrontal tDCS every weekday for 4 weeks, then two tDCS sessions per week for 2 weeks, or sham stimulation at the same intervals. Randomisation was stratified by site and baseline Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score (ie, <31 or ≥31). Participants, raters, and operators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was change on the MADRS at week 6, analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one treatment session. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02530164).

Findings
Between Jan 19, 2016, and June 15, 2020, 3601 individuals were assessed for eligibility. 160 patients were included and randomly assigned to receive either active tDCS (n=83) or sham tDCS (n=77). Six patients withdrew consent and four patients were found to have been wrongly included, so data from 150 patients were analysed (89 [59%] were female and 61 [41%] were male). No intergroup difference was found in mean improvement on the MADRS at week 6 between the active tDCS group (n=77; –8·2, SD 7·2) and the sham tDCS group (n=73; –8·0, 9·3; difference 0·3 [95% CI –2·4 to 2·9]). Significantly more participants had one or more mild adverse events in the active tDCS group (50 [60%] of 83) than in the sham tDCS group (33 [43%] of 77; p=0·028).

Interpretation
Active tDCS was not superior to sham stimulation during a 6-week period. Our trial does not support the efficacy of tDCS as an additional treatment to SSRIs in adults with MDD.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9970685541629791

I choose neuroscience because I am fascinated with the brain and although I am not pre-med I hope to continue my path in research or perhaps industry. The field of neuroscience is incredibly interdisciplinary, and I know for the future I will need to build a discipline along with this degree. The dream is too work at a company such as NeuraLink, using brain-computer interfaces, or even a more computational neuroscience approach.  
  
I am thinking about either majoring in Electrical Engineering, or Computer Science. However the problem lies that these two fields as well as Neuroscience don't offer Minors. So it would either be a complete switch to an engineering degree, or a double major which is unrealistic (unless??). This also requires switching to the Fulton College outside of the Life Sciences College (I meet the requirements to switch). Through the Life Sciences College however they offer Minors in Data Science as well as Computational Mathematics which would be much more plausible to add to a Neuroscience Major.  
  
I was wondering if you guys had any thoughts or words of advice? Whether it be advice for future job opportunity in industry compared to academia. Advice about Double Majoring or switching to engineering heavy degree. All comments and thoughts are greatly appreciated.

3D bioprinting of human neural tissues with functional connectivity,,"**Highlights**

* Functional human neural tissues assembled by 3D bioprinting
* Neural circuits formed between defined neural subtypes
* Functional connections established between cortical-striatal tissues
* Printed tissues for modeling neural network impairment

**Summary**

Probing how human neural networks operate is hindered by the lack of reliable human neural tissues amenable to the dynamic functional assessment of neural circuits. We developed a 3D bioprinting platform to assemble tissues with defined human neural cell types in a desired dimension using a commercial bioprinter. The printed neuronal progenitors differentiate into neurons and form functional neural circuits within and between tissue layers with specificity within weeks, evidenced by the cortical-to-striatal projection, spontaneous synaptic currents, and synaptic response to neuronal excitation. Printed astrocyte progenitors develop into mature astrocytes with elaborated processes and form functional neuron-astrocyte networks, indicated by calcium flux and glutamate uptake in response to neuronal excitation under physiological and pathological conditions. These designed human neural tissues will likely be useful for understanding the wiring of human neural networks, modeling pathological processes, and serving as platforms for drug testing.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9961150884628296

Consciousness in the cradle: on the emergence of infant experience," Theorists 1 defend a ‘late-onset’ view, suggesting that consciousness requires cognitive capacities which are unlikely to be in place before the child’s first birthday at the very earliest. 

Theorists 2 defend an ‘early-onset’ account, suggesting that consciousness is likely to be in place at birth or shortly after and may even arise during the third trimester. 

Progress in this field has been difficult, not just because of the challenges associated with procuring the relevant behavioral and neural data, but also because of lack of verbal feedback.

Infant consciousness can have important implications for debates about the mechanisms underlying consciousness  and would have important clinical, ethical, and perhaps even legal implications on the treatment of children. 

My personal theory is: This study can help us understand people with extreme learning disabilities by knowing which brain development stages they missed out on. And detect problems in early childhood that can be better handled with special education focused on dealing with their specific disability, leading to a disabled child's success in life.",other,POSITIVE,0.980712890625

I see this often in science. Amazing research techniques to study a question no one ever defined. I know it's useful to start research to see where you're going to go and define the problem along the way, but at several points here, conscienceness (heretofore, c) is conflated with experience. David Chalmers bet someone a case of wine that, after 25 years of brain research, they still would not have found the neural correlates of c. Some international congress of research centers gathered all the evidence and concluded: nope, not there yet. Babies experience experience (sic) from day 1 and probably before. But can they reflect on it? It's so easy to test their reaction to novelty because their experience of experience is so powerful, it's all they have. There's no room for c. Great artists are great for this very same reason, total immersion in experience.

The desire for objectivity, is so strong, and there seems to be a professional fear of apparent subjectivity, so no one has stopped to give a good definition of which is which. The definition of c is a philosophical question, so we must ignored it.

There's the same problem in the mud-wrestling match between Chomsky and Everett and cohorts on recursion. They've each proven very effectively that the other is wrong, but no one will mention that there might be another solution. Why? The definition of recursion. This involves language, mind, brain, and natural reality (which recursion is meant to describe, and mind is the abstract function of the brain, which is physical). But the debate is almost entirely devoted to syntax. Why? The definition of recursion. Weasley definitions confuse the discussion of syntax.

The biggest problem of objectivity vs subjectivity in brain related stuff, neuro/psyco/linguistic science, is definition. Ad hoc definitions are Ok, in fact necessary, if you deal with their adhocness.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9830465912818909

Synthetic surprise as the foundation of the psychedelic experience,,"Wow! Very fascinating. I can still remember my first psychedelic (i.e., psilocybin) experience like it was yesterday. It happened in August 2013. I'm not sure what good a brain scan would do at this point, but the experience followed a year of frequent (i.e., weekly) MDMA use. I had become aware of the 5-HT receptors and their relationship to serotonin transmission shortly after. It's possible, had brain imaging been conducted at this time, that a subsequent misfiring of these receptors, caused by consistent, abnormally excessive neurotransmission at these sites, would have been detected.

I could say much more, but I will be brief. This notion of synthetic surprise is illuminating, as the degree of phenomenological shock brought about by the trip, in the context of predictive error and unexpected uncertainty, was so incredible as to be considerably traumatizing. I imagine that my brain chemistry was altered permanently. Much of my studies since then (i.e., in philosophy, psychology, and more recently neuroscience) has more or less had to do with unpacking and attempting to understand not only the exceptionally positive but also perplexing, socio-psychologico-somatically debilitating nature of this single event.",other,POSITIVE,0.6527162194252014

Synthetic surprise as the foundation of the psychedelic experience,,"Damn, that's a hell of a paper.

It's interesting to think about this from a predictive coding account.

Higher weighted priors, and more ""surprising"" predictive errors can account for the sort of ""soul searching"" or ""profoundness"" of psychedelics.

It's interesting to see the role of the 5ht system in predictive coding, as dopaminergic signalling seems to have been the main focus of predictive coding work for a while. Perhaps I've been limited in what I've been reading, though.

"During sleep, the brain uncouples different regions in its outermost layer, reducing the neuronal signaling between them. A recent mouse study reveals the types of neurons involved.",,"Heres a Brief Summary from what I read about this....

 The study in mice shows how the brain balances deep sleep while remaining responsive to urgent stimuli by uncoupling certain brain regions. It uses **channelrhodopsin** to activate neurons, revealing that activity in the **primary visual cortex** (V1) is not effectively transmitted to the **anterior cingulate area** (ACA) during deep sleep. **Increased activity in specific neurons (PV neurons)** was noted, suggesting a role in this uncoupling process.  
  
Implications: This research could enhance understanding of brain function during sleep and lead to therapies for sleep disorders. Understanding how the brain uncouples regions could inform more specific treatments for maintaining healthy sleep patterns.

&#x200B;

Definitions: 

**Channelrhodopsin** is a light-sensitive protein used in neuroscience to control neurons' activity with light, a method known as optogenetics. 

**The primary visual cortex (V1)** is the brain's part responsible for processing visual information. The **anterior cingulate area (ACA)** is involved in various cognitive and emotional functions, integrating signals from other brain regions like V1. 

**PV neurons**, or **Parvalbumin-expressing neurons**, are a type of inhibitory neuron known to regulate the activity of other neurons, playing a critical role in neural circuits, including those related to sleep and wakefulness. (think like a Binary Switch)",other,NEGATIVE,0.9898625612258911

I've been loving my lab, and my PI and lab members have been excellent so far, but I was wondering about what the research flexibility of having a degree in neuroscience was like?

I constantly find myself attracted to the neuroscientific aspects of psychiatry but our lab focuses on neurotrauma and motor recovery with some behavioural work thrown in (usually anxiety). While I'm totally fine with studying this for my PhD, I'm curious how easy it might be to push my career closer to psychiatry while still staying in neuroscience when it comes time to start thinking of post-doc positions. Doing an MD in psychiatry after my PhD or transferring into the MD/PhD program would be amazing but I'm already in my 30's and have a family so hesitate to practically double my time in grad school and dig myself financially even lower than if I'd just stuck with PhD alone (taking on loans for the MD part; I at least get a stipend salary for PhD).

If it helps, my interests often center around topics concerning dysfunctional neuroplasticity and its underpinning influence in disorders such as anxiety, PTSD, and schizophrenia. Any work I could get in neurostimulation or especially TMS would be a huge bonus. I also have a significant background in psychoacoustics and neuropharmacology from my honours degree where I worked in behavioural neuroscience.

TLDR: Neuroscience grad student who loves neuroscience but also eventually wants to study psychiatric topics in the future. Will a PhD in neuroscience be sufficient for this or will I need additional training after graduation to do this?",other,NEGATIVE,0.9973115921020508

I'm not sure if it's the right place to ask as I'm new to the sub reddit.   
I wish to ask if someone has any knowledge/studies concerning this topic:   


How buprenorphine effects the serotonin system in the brain(specifically serotonin syndrome) as I can't seem to find any data/studies on the matter.  I wish for details and studies on the matter if possible.   


It has been known that some opiods like Tramadol, Fentanyl, Methadone and others can block the SERT from re-uptaking serotonin and some like in the case of Fent can even act as agonists on some of the receptors. But other opiods like Morphine and Buprenorphine haven't been found to have such an effect.   


Even though they don't seem to have such a direct effect on the SERT or 5HT receptors, there have been cases of people who have suffered from serotonin syndrome whilst for example taking SSRIs and Buprenorphine or other serotonin effecting drugs, so in some way buprenorphine must be effecting the serotonin system.   


This could be due to it's Antagonist properties on the KOR opiod system which can have a cascading effect on the serotonin systems, but I'm not seeing it make sense that it would be to the point of causing serotonin syndrome unless some person has some genetic variation making it prone to it.   


But I personally can't find any studies or knowledge on the matter. Any data would be highly appreciated as I'm trying to learn on the topic. But if this is not the right place to post such questions I apologise as I'm new to the sub and I understood that this is the area to post such topics.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9986904263496399

Hello everyone, I'm \[28M\] reaching out to this community in hopes of gaining some insights and advice. I find myself at a significant crossroads in my career and life: I'm considering going back to school for behavioral neuroscience after a decade away from the academic world.

  
To give you a bit of background, I graduated college about 10 years ago and have since been working in, sales (tech & real estate) a field quite unrelated to neuroscience or science in general. However, I've always been captivated by the intricacies of the human brain and its profound impact on our behaviors and life experiences. My aspiration is to explore this fascination further and ultimately teach others how to use insights from neuroscience for self-development and life optimization.

  
Additionally, I have a strong interest in philosophy, which I believe can beautifully intersect with neuroscience. I'm intrigued by the philosophical questions about the mind, consciousness, and human experience and how these can be explored through the lens of neuroscience.Here's where I need your advice:  
1. \*\*Science and Math Readiness:\*\* Given that my background in science and math is somewhat limited, I'm concerned about how I'll fare in these essential components of a neuroscience program. If anyone has suggestions for brushing up on these subjects or preparatory courses that could help, I'd greatly appreciate it.

  
2. \*\*Balancing Studies with Life:\*\* For those who have ventured back to academia later in life, how did you manage the juggle between studying, working, and personal life? Any strategies or tips would be extremely helpful.

  
3. \*\*Philosophy and Neuroscience Career Path:\*\* I am curious about the feasibility of merging my interests in neuroscience and philosophy into a career, particularly one focused on teaching and self-development. Are there specific niches or career paths in neuroscience that would align with this dual interest?

  
4. \*\*Setting Realistic Expectations:\*\* I'm eager to hear your honest opinions on whether this is a practical goal, especially considering my extended break from academics and my current lack of a substantial science foundation.  
Your thoughts, experiences, and any guidance you can offer would be incredibly valuable to me as I navigate this potential change in my life's direction.

  
Thank you so much for reading my post and for any advice you might offer. I look forward to your responses and insights.

  
Warm regards",other,POSITIVE,0.9947711825370789

Serotonin and depression—an alternative interpretation of the data in Moncrieff et al.,,"Moncrieff et al. [1] report in a review of reviews that depression is not generally linked with serotonin deficiency. This is hardly news to neuropharmacologists, which Moncrieff et al. tacitly admits, as they justify their review by citing examples of laity and general practitioners believing depression is caused by a “chemical imbalance”, i.e., in serotonin. For instance, already in 1986 did Depue and Spoont point out that serotonin deficiency may not be a general cause of depression or other psychiatric illness [2]. Further, that increasing extracellular serotonin—e.g., with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)—treats depression does not mean decreased serotonin causes depression.

Of course, none of the parameters reviewed by Moncrieff are validated biomarkers of chronic state-levels of extracellular brain serotonin, the biologically active serotonin pool. Measuring state-levels of brain extracellular serotonin can at current only be done by intracerebral microdialysis, which is invasive, and hence feasible only in animals.

Moncrieff et al. appears unfamiliar with serotonin biology and pharmacology. The review contains factual errors, makes conclusions serotonin neurobiology may not support, and quotes the cited literature in a selective manner. Most troubling, they misinterpret some data reviewed and intimate that serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, e.g., SSRIs, may decrease, rather than increase, serotonin function. If accepted among the laity and general practitioners, such notions could lead to reduced use of antidepressants among patients in need and increased morbidity related to depression.

Depression is highly heterogenic, in etiology and presentation. Unsurprisingly, no biological anomaly, serotonergic or otherwise, consistently segregate with depression as the broad syndrome. However, a therapy need not to work by reversing a primary biological anomaly to be effective. Modulating monoaminergic, GABAergic, glutamatergic, or vagal function treats depression, in the face of little evidence that a primary anomaly is corrected. Analogous, most drugs for pain, cancer, epilepsy, and obesity do not address the primary pathogenic anomaly, but treat the pathology or relive symptoms via distinct, compensatory mechanisms. Moncrieff et al. would have served the readers better by taking this fundamental fact into consideration.

Space does not allow a full critique. Instead, in the following I list and discuss exemplars of the most obvious errors in Moncrieff et al.

Moncrieff et al. states, without qualification, that 5-HT1A receptors are inhibitory pre-synaptic auto-receptors. But that is true only for 5-HT1A receptors on serotonergic neurons. 5-HT1A hetero-receptors are located post-synaptically throughout the brain, most prominently in the hippocampus, which is described in the review Moncrieff et al. quotes [3]. Moncrieff et al. interprets a trend to reduced 5-HT1A receptors expression in depression as a potential marker of increased extracellular serotonin in depression. Just focusing on pre-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors, reduced 5-HT1A receptors expression could equally well be interpreted as an anatomically underdeveloped serotonin system, and hence evidence of reduced extracellular serotonin. Both interpretations remain speculative. In the Discussion, Moncrieff et al. speculates that reduced 5-HT1A receptors after antidepressant treatment in humans may reflect a compensatory mechanism to a serotonin-lowering effect of antidepressants. Yet, there seems to be little pre-clinical evidence that in support of such a mechanism. For instance, neither increasing nor decreasing extracellular serotonin changes pre-synaptic 5-HT1A receptor levels in the midbrain [4, 5]. Further, the same type of considerations and uncertainties apply to the discussion of apparently altered levels of serotonin transporters in depression in Moncrieff et al.

Moncrieff et al. quotes a well-known meta-analysis by Ruhé et al. concluding that tryptophan depletion minimally changes mood in healthy volunteers (not treated with antidepressants) [6]. That corresponds to animal microdialysis studies from the 1990s reporting that tryptophan depletion barely lowers brain extracellular serotonin in animals not treated with an antidepressant [7, 8]. However, animal studies find that tryptophan depletion potently lowers, to baseline, extracellular serotonin levels previously elevated by chronic serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant treatment [7, 9]. That corresponds to the conclusion in the meta-analysis by Ruhé et al. that tryptophan depletion across studies statistically significantly causes depression relapse in patients remitted on, and still treated with, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant [6]. These data suggest that sustained elevation of extracellular serotonin is important for sustained antidepressant response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors; but, Moncrieff et al. does not mention this body of literature.

Moncrieff et al. quotes findings of reduced plasma serotonin after serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment in humans as evidence of reduced brain extracellular serotonin and function. Again, a leap of faith, since peripheral and brain serotonin are two distinct pools of serotonin. Regardless, the interpretation of the data is problematic. The vast majority of blood serotonin is concentrated in platelet granules, being absorbed from the plasma by serotonin transporters located on platelets [10]. It has long been known that serotonin reuptake inhibitors inhibit platelet serotonin transporters, reduce platelet serotonin storage, and substantially decrease overall blood serotonin concentrations [11]. Baseline plasma serotonin appears extremely low, but cannot be measured reliably, as even modest platelet degranulation upon blood sampling overwhelms baseline plasma serotonin. This issues is well-described in the literature [10]. Hence, low plasma serotonin in depression patients treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors likely reflect reduced platelet serotonin storage, not reduced brain extracellular serotonin.

Overall, while Moncrieff et al. provides a handy overview of the literature on serotonin system markers in depression, it brings little new to the table. Further, the selective quoting of the literature and the debatable conclusions exemplified above may not be helpful to the scientific discourse or to patients.",interest_in_research,NEGATIVE,0.995383620262146

I was accepted to a life sciences PhD program where I am going to pursue a neuro PhD. I am actually in it right now doing the first orientation semester. I am rotating in labs currently.

I wanted to do human behavior research, but survey data rubs me the wrong way with how easily it is dismissed and explained away despite its statistical validity and reproducibility. I wanted to get into fMRI, TMS, other scanning techniques, and physiological data to back up any research I did.

However, I ended up joining a fruit fly lab and dissecting larvae expressing fluorescence in neurons and it was a lot of fun. It was more tangible, I think. I could do something in the lab that day and have a result and keep building off of that.

Now I am stuck as to what I should do. I kind of want to do the fruit fly lab, but I want to end up working with humans in some capacity. I think I just like more definitive answers as opposed to correlations. 

I am mostly interested in decision-making and identity. Why one individual is more likely to make a choice (or not make a choice) than another. Underlying that, I think is emotion, or how we value things positively and negatively. I think I may be able to find some remnant of this in fruit flies as well. Positive or negative evaluation of a smell (e.g. food vs toxic). I am also interested in brain-computer interfaces and other technology. Would learning cellular biology/neuroscience be better than fMRI and neuropsychology? 

I like aspects of each pathway and am not sure which to choose. I think it's also a bit of people-pleasing. I am doing my best in each rotation. So, I think I am taking on the likes and dislikes of the people I am working with to get in the mindset of how things would be in this lab.

Sorry, a bit of stream of consciousness going on here. I have time before I have to decide, but the decision has been stressing me out.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9805388450622559

I was recently accepted to a Neuro PhD program in Italy, at my base uni. I have a psychological background, both my bachelor's and master's. Now, I'm happy but it was a bit shocking to be accepted since I tried to apply to test the environment.

The point is that I had different plans: I want to go to Northern Europe to pursue a PhD in Neuro or Psy over there. I've been studying the language for months now, watching vlogs about it, and so on and so on.

I've been on an emotional roller coaster. Initially, I was supposed to work in a pharm-oriented environment, in particular with mice and degenerative disease models. That would have been not-so-great for me, given my purely psychological background. I would probably have preferred to not work there, under those conditions. Suddenly though, the magic happened: I was told that I would be assigned to a more clinical-focused department and supervisor, working mainly with psychiatric patients.

Now, my question to people already in PhD neuro or above is: since conditions changed, should I go on and take the chance to pursue my PhD at my uni (small one, insular)? Or, should I decline the position and wait for a more beneficial position in the North (Denmark, Norway, Sweden)? I know it is very subjective but, work-wise, what would you do?

Currently I’m a junior in undergrad majoring in Neuroscience, and I’m having a hard time deciding what path would be best fit for me post graduation. I’ve never really been all that interested in going to med school and wouldn’t want to put all that focus into something I don’t truly love. My main focus has been research, but recently I’ve been more interested in the pathology side of Neuroscience. Everyone I’ve talked to about pathology career options has said I would HAVE to go to med school to become a pathologist, but are there other options more focused on the research track? Or even other similar research options in different neuroscience focuses?

I’m a sophomore in undergrad at a liberal arts college majoring in neuro and planning to minor in chem, but I have the option to declare biochem as my second major. I’m very interested in neuropharmacology, and I intend to pursue a PhD in that field. I’m not sure whether to add the biochem major, which would entail taking physics, calc, and a few more chem classes (I’ve almost completed the minor), and nothing else besides distribution requirements. If I didn’t do the biochem major, I’d probably take a more well-rounded set of STEM classes, including upper level math, CS, stats, etc. I’m not sure which type of coursework would look best for PhD program admissions — any thoughts?

As a side note, I do really like chem (I’m taking ochem right now and loving it), but I’m not a very talented chemist. I’m not sure if having a second major would help me with PhD admissions, especially if it would bring my gpa down a little bit. I also worry about not having the freedom to take other classes, and wonder if CS skills would be more valuable than a biochem degree. 

This option will only be on the table for the next few months, so I need to make a choice soon. Any advice would be appreciated!",other,NEGATIVE,0.9960059523582458

Mitochondrial DNA damage triggers spread of Parkinson’s disease-like pathology,"Until recently, our understanding of Parkinson's disease has been quite limited, which has been apparent in the limited treatment options and management of this debilitating condition.

Our recent understanding has primarily revolved around the genetic factors responsible for familial cases, while the causative factors in the vast majority of patients remained unknown.

However, in a new study, researchers from the University of Copenhagen have unveiled new insights into the workings of the brain in Parkinson's patients. Leading the groundbreaking discovery is Professor Shohreh Issazadeh-Navikas.

""For the first time, we can show that mitochondria, the vital energy producers within brain cells, particularly neurons, undergo damage, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial DNA[LP1].  This initiates and spreads the disease like a wildfire through the brain,"" says Shohreh Issazadeh-Navikas and adds:

""Our findings establish that the spread of the damaged genetic material, the mitochondrial DNA, causes the symptoms reminiscent of Parkinson's disease and its progression to dementia.""

Parkinson's disease is a chronic condition that affects the central nervous system, leading to symptoms such as difficulty walking, tremors, cognitive challenges, and, eventually, dementia. — ScienceDaily","Abstract: 

*In the field of neurodegenerative diseases, especially sporadic Parkinson’s disease (sPD) with dementia (sPDD), the question of how the disease starts and spreads in the brain remains central. While prion-like proteins have been designated as a culprit, recent studies suggest the involvement of additional factors. We found that oxidative stress, damaged DNA binding, cytosolic DNA sensing, and Toll-Like Receptor (TLR)4/9 activation pathways are strongly associated with the sPDD transcriptome, which has dysregulated type I Interferon (IFN) signaling. In sPD patients, we confirmed deletions of mitochondrial (mt)DNA in the medial frontal gyrus, suggesting a potential role of damaged mtDNA in the disease pathophysiology. To explore its contribution to pathology, we used spontaneous models of sPDD caused by deletion of type I IFN signaling (Ifnb–/–/Ifnar–/– mice). We found that the lack of neuronal IFNβ/IFNAR leads to oxidization, mutation, and deletion in mtDNA, which is subsequently released outside the neurons. Injecting damaged mtDNA into mouse brain induced PDD-like behavioral symptoms, including neuropsychiatric, motor, and cognitive impairments. Furthermore, it caused neurodegeneration in brain regions distant from the injection site, suggesting that damaged mtDNA triggers spread of PDD characteristics in an “infectious-like” manner. We also discovered that the mechanism through which damaged mtDNA causes pathology in healthy neurons is independent of Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase and IFNβ/IFNAR, but rather involves the dual activation of TLR9/4 pathways, resulting in increased oxidative stress and neuronal cell death, respectively. Our proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles containing damaged mtDNA identified the TLR4 activator, Ribosomal Protein S3 as a key protein involved in recognizing and extruding damaged mtDNA. These findings might shed light on new molecular pathways through which damaged mtDNA initiates and spreads PD-like disease, potentially opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions or disease monitoring.*",other,NEGATIVE,0.9933220744132996

I have been getting passed around by profs for the better part of 2 years now regarding my academic interests. I get told my psychologists to go to neuroscience, and neuroscientists tell me to be a psychologist, psychiatrists tell me to go do either. 

It’s not very deep, but essentially, I would say at least, I’m very interested in neuroscience. I love discuss if the brain, the how and why of how it works, with a primary focus in Neuro-chemistry. The issues arise because my main focus is the effects of medications in the treatment of mental health disorders. I am a big advocate for lifestyle changes and exploring various avenues before medicating, which makes people point me in the route of psychology. I am NOT anti medication, I very much am pro and understand that it is deeply necessary for most illnesses and disorders. My concern though is that they are under studied, unethically studied, and over prescribed. As such, I enjoy studying their effects to gain a perspective outside of what the big Pharma companies say about it. The other issue that arises is that when it comes to the disorders like Bipolar or schizophrenia etc., I’m very interested in the childhoods of those people, their past, their lifestyles, their diets, essentially how they may have ended up here if it wasn’t simply genetic. 

While this all seemed fairly Psychology focused, I’ve looked into it deeply, and I’m not interested. I have no interest in being a psychologist or clinical psychologist at all. Im great at the people aspect, but I don’t like nor want to spend all day in a sad environment talking about other peoples feelings all day. If I am listening to their problems, I don’t want to refer them to a psychiatrist, I’d like to be the psychiatrist, discuss potential avenues of benefit (when and where applicable) and then prescribe if I see fit. It’s hard to explain but I am much more neuroscience focused, I would say.

Recommendation for a journal fitting an fMRI study on social decision-making,"Hi! 

I am a PhD student in Germany in my final year on the topic of Neuroscience and Psychology. I am struggling with the decision of which journal to submit my last paper to. The topic is on social decision-making using fMRI and the sample size is N = 100. I am aware that without reading the paper it is hard to tell where it belongs, but I wanted to get feedback from people who are more used to submitting papers to different journals. 

I was considering PNAS, which has a high impact factor but I'm afraid the review process will be quite long and delay finishing my PhD a lot. 

I would have especially considered Neuroimage but I am not sure how it works now with the resignation of all the editors, whether this will affect the impact factor in the future and the review process. 

Also, I think SCAN might be a good fit, but I would prefer to send it to a journal with a higher IF first. I would be very happy with any recommendations or opinions (especially about the length/difficulty of the review process and the future of Neuroscience journals). 

Thanks a lot in advance!","Your paper will not get into PNAS, unless it is fundamental, revolutionary, or several of the authors are high impact publishers. Modulate your expectations. You might as well say you were thinking of nature neuroscience, they're on a semilat level. 

And for the record, you're almost definitely not getting in nature neuroscience either! 

Do you not have a supervisor to provide you context for this? The choice of where to submit a paper is always a little difficult, because you have to understand where it fits in the context of the existing research. PNAS is a glam journal, so glam papers get into there. That requires a number of factors, including highly topical, advanced but elegant analytical methods, all sorts of interesting little bits. 

More likely you should be aiming for a mid-tier journal. Unless your paper is something extraordinary, this is where the vast majority of decent quality research goes, and that's okay. 

SCAN It's quite probably a good choice and a very solid journal in that field. Don't let impact factors fool you, good journal is good journal. Image got replaced with neuroimagr for replace with imaging neuroscience, so You could try there. It will probably come as a nice impact journal. It's open access so they're a fees, But the whole point is they are significantly less than neuroimage. You could also consider human brain mapping, journal of cognitive neuroscience, if the paper involves networks you could try network neuroscience. If you have enough money you could try cerebral cortex, but even without open access it can be pricey, and for that reason I kind of hate them. 

Good luck.",other,POSITIVE,0.8419597148895264

Epstein-Barr virus-acquired immunodeficiency in myalgic encephalomyelitis-Is it present in long COVID?,"* **NEW ARTICLE PUBLISHED!**  
Unraveling the Connections Between EBV, Long COVID, and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis  
After months of meticulous review and analysis, I am proud to present a study that explores the deep connections between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis. The findings, while fascinating, urge us to rethink our current understanding of these conditions:  
1️⃣ **EBV as a link:** This review article suggests that EBV may be a catalyst, inducing similar symptoms in Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, and orchestrating far-reaching immune challenges.  
2️⃣ **Immunodeficiency and Ectopic Lymphoid Aggregates:** One of the most intriguing and alarming findings regarding EBV is its ability to induce the formation of structures called ectopic lymphoid aggregates in tissues. These structures are not benign; in fact, they can be potent instigators of inflammatory responses that disrupt normal tissue function. Why does this occur? This review suggests that in individuals with certain genetic characteristics - specifically those with ""weak"" HLA-II haplotypes against EBV - this virus can become more easily established, leading to the formation of these aggregates. Most worryingly, these aggregates not only cause inflammation, but may also contribute to a form of acquired immunodeficiency, further weakening the body's defenses and even developing autoimmune diseases.  
3️⃣ **Consequences:**
* **Development of Autoimmune Diseases:** EBV, by interacting with certain genetic haplotypes, can increase the risk of autoimmune diseases. The infection triggers an immune response that, in combination with genetic predispositions, can confuse the body's own tissues with foreign agents, leading to an autoimmune attack.
* **Chronic Innate Immune Response:** EBV infection weakens the T-cell response, causing persistent inflammation due to a constant activation of the innate immune system.
* **Reactivation and Transient Autoantibodies:** T-cell dysfunction leads to viral reactivations. During these reactivation episodes, the body may produce transient autoantibodies that may contribute to clinical symptoms. These autoantibodies may come and go depending on the stage of infection and viral reactivation.
* **Abortive Lytic Replications:** EBV cells can begin, but not complete, lytic replications, releasing proteins that intensify inflammation.
* **Hypocortisolism:** A reduction in cortisol levels. This hormone is essential for numerous functions in the body, including stress management. An imbalance can have profound effects on overall health.
* **Microclot formation**: These tiny clots can hinder blood flow, which in turn affects the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to tissues.
* **Insulin Resistance:** There is a connection between EBV infection and insulin resistance, which may contribute to metabolic complications.
* **Serotonergic Disruption**: It is notable how EBV affects serotonin levels, with an increase in the gut and a decrease in the central nervous system. This dichotomy may be at the root of several symptoms.
* **Hypozincemia and Decreased Ceruloplasmin:** Infection can lead to decreased levels of zinc and ceruloplasmin in the body, affecting immune function and other processes.
* **Oxidative Stress and Inflammation:** EBV infection intensifies oxidative stress and inflammation, depleting the body's antioxidant defenses and contributing to a vicious cycle of cellular damage.
* **IDO Pathway Activation:** This metabolic pathway, essential for tryptophan degradation, is impaired, which may have implications for mood and neurological function.
* **Nitrosative Stress:** Increased nitrosative stress may contribute to cellular damage and alter mitochondrial function.
* **Altered Microbiota:** Chronic EBV infection of the intestinal mucosa compromises the intestinal barrier. Increased serotonin in the gut causes inflammation, which combined with an increase in proinflammatory cytokines, leads to increased intestinal permeability. This results in an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine and development of food intolerances. Vitamin deficiencies may also occur due to inadequate absorption.
* **Transactivation of Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERV):** EBV can activate genes in HERVs, specifically the env gene of HERV-K18, through their latent proteins. These superantigens may contribute to immune fatigue and a state of anergy in T lymphocytes.

4️⃣ **Sex Differences**: The role of gender differences is critical in affecting EBV interaction and symptom manifestation. Biological sex may influence the interaction with EBV. Estrogens in women increase B-cell survival and antibody release, but may also amplify risks with EBV, potentially promoting autoimmune conditions.  
Women's menstrual cycles further complicate this situation, as phases such as ovulation cause potential immunosuppression and increase vulnerability to viral reactivations.  
In men, testosterone shapes the immune response differently, often favoring a more effective defense against intracellular pathogens. This distinction may affect the progression and manifestation of conditions such as ME/CFS and Long COVID.  
**5️⃣ Treatments that could improve or worsen symptoms:**

* **Hydrocortisone:**  
Advantage: Potential to address hypocortisolism.  
Disadvantage: May have limited or adverse effects in patients with ME/CFS, as HPA axis hypofunction is a consequence, not a cause, of immune impairment. In addition, it could worsen immunodeficiency and EBV reactivation. Therefore, it would not be recommended.
* **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):**  
Advantage: They could help restore serotonergic impairment, especially at the CNS level.  
Disadvantage: At the peripheral level, they could exacerbate hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. In addition, they could worsen intestinal symptoms due to increased serotonin at the intestinal level. Other alternatives are better.
* **Metformin:**  
Advantage: May be beneficial by reducing ROS production, improving insulin sensitivity, and not associated with risk of hypoglycemia.  
Disadvantage: Side effects of the drug.
* **N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and other antioxidants:**  
Advantage: Help reduce oxidative stress. They may decrease the risk of developing EBV-associated cancer and also inhibit NF-κB activation.  
Disadvantage: No specific adverse effects are mentioned at normal doses.
* **Hydroxychloroquine:**  
Advantage: May be useful by increasing intracellular zinc and decreasing SARS-CoV-2 replication.  
Disadvantage: Promotes reactivation of EBV and other herpesviruses, which may contribute to long-term development of lymphomas. In addition, it limits T-cell responses and may increase oxidative stress. Its use would not be recommended.
* **Antivirals such as valganciclovir or valacyclovir:**  
Advantage: May reduce reactivation, inflammation, appearance of temporary autoantibodies and insulin resistance.  
Disadvantage: Side effects of the drug.
* **Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy:**  
Advantage: May increase pathogen clearance, synthesis of various growth factors, and angiogenesis.  
Disadvantage: Increased oxidative stress may generate higher levels of ROS and reactive nitrogen species, leading to more oxidative and nitrosative damage. Therefore, this therapy could be useful for those viruses that do not generate latency, such as SARS-CoV-2, but could be detrimental for viruses that do generate latency, such as EBV, as it promotes the increase of latent cells by increasing oxidative stress.
* In summary, the symptoms of individuals with EBV-acquired immunodeficiency could be improved with the combined use of antioxidant supplements, antivirals, and metformin. The use of anticoagulants could also be considered.  
I hope this study will serve as an aid to all professionals and sufferers seeking answers in the maze of symptoms and treatments associated with these conditions.

A brain-computer typing interface using finger movements - PubMed,,">Abstract: 
Intracortical brain computer interfaces (iBCIs) decode neural activity from the cortex and enable motor and communication prostheses, such as cursor control, handwriting and speech, for people with paralysis. This paper introduces a new iBCI communication prosthesis using a 3D keyboard interface for typing using continuous, closed loop movement of multiple fingers. A participant-specific BCI keyboard prototype was developed for a BrainGate2 clinical trial participant (T5) using neural recordings from the hand-knob area of the left premotor cortex. We assessed the relative decoding accuracy of flexion/extension movements of individual single fingers (5 degrees of freedom (DOF)) vs. three groups of fingers (thumb, index-middle, and ring-small fingers, 3 DOF). Neural decoding using 3 independent DOF was more accurate (95%) than that using 5 DOF (76%). A virtual keyboard was then developed where each finger group moved along a flexion-extension arc to acquire targets that corresponded to English letters and symbols. The locations of these lette[REDACTED] were optimized using natural language statistics, resulting in an approximately a 2× reduction in distance traveled by fingers on average compared to a random keyboard layout. This keyboard was tested using a simple real-time closed loop decoder enabling T5 to type with 31 symbols at 90% accuracy and approximately 2.3 sec/symbol (excluding a 2 second hold time) on average.",interest_in_research,NEGATIVE,0.997160792350769

The back and forth, but then watching all the actual neuroscience people start poking fun at both sides of this debate. Quite amusing. 

What the hell is consciousness anyway? All these debates over what it is and how to establish it, and for the most part it's basically a sort of trumped-up philosophy. I wouldn't quite go so far as calling it if it's pseudoscience, that's pretty aggressive, but I don't believe any of the tools that we have available to us are able to meeting fully measure consciousness or the emergent properties of the brain which might drive it, and so essentially people are making unsupported theories based on minimal available data and large amounts of supposition. 

Sometimes building theories without strong foundational support is okay, because then you can seek out foundational support and try to confirm or disconfirm the theory, that's how theory works.

But honestly, it's interesting as this question is, and as fundamental as it is to the human condition, I'm going to spend very little time seriously thinking about it because anything we come up with at this point feels like pure supposition.

Interictal spikes in Alzheimer's disease: Preclinical evidence for dominance of the dentate gyrus and cholinergic control by medial septum,,"**Highlights**

* Interictal spikes (IIS) occur in 3 mouse lines with Alzheimer's disease features.
* IIS in all 3 mouse lines were most frequent during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.
* The dentate gyrus showed larger IIS and earlier current sources vs. CA1 or cortex.
* Chemogenetic silencing of medial septum (MS) cholinergic neurons reduced IIS in REM.
* MS silencing did not change REM latency, duration, number of bouts or theta power. 

**Abstract**

Interictal spikes (IIS) are a common type of abnormal electrical activity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and preclinical models. The brain regions where IIS are largest are not known but are important because such data would suggest sites that contribute to IIS generation. Because hippocampus and cortex exhibit altered excitability in AD models, we asked which areas dominate the activity during IIS along the cortical-CA1-dentate gyrus (DG) dorso-ventral axis. Because medial septal (MS) cholinergic neurons are overactive when IIS typically occur, we also tested the novel hypothesis that silencing the MS cholinergic neurons selectively would reduce IIS.

We used mice that simulate aspects of AD: Tg2576 mice, presenilin 2 (PS2) knockout mice and Ts65Dn mice. To selectively silence MS cholinergic neurons, Tg2576 mice were bred with choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT)-Cre mice and offspring were injected in the MS with AAV encoding inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). We recorded local field potentials along the cortical-CA1-DG axis using silicon probes during wakefulness, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

We detected IIS in all transgenic or knockout mice but not age-matched controls. IIS were detectable throughout the cortical-CA1-DG axis and occurred primarily during REM sleep. In all 3 mouse lines, IIS amplitudes were significantly greater in the DG granule cell layer vs. CA1 pyramidal layer or overlying cortex. Current source density analysis showed robust and early current sources in the DG, and additional sources in CA1 and the cortex also. Selective chemogenetic silencing of MS cholinergic neurons significantly reduced IIS rate during REM sleep without affecting the overall duration, number of REM bouts, latency to REM sleep, or theta power during REM. Notably, two control interventions showed no effects.

Consistent maximal amplitude and strong current sources of IIS in the DG suggest that the DG is remarkably active during IIS. In addition, selectively reducing MS cholinergic tone, at times when MS is hyperactive, could be a new strategy to reduce IIS in AD.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9566984176635742

Endocannabinoid release at ventral hippocampal-amygdala synapses regulates stress-induced behavioral adaptation,,"**Highlights**

* BLA activity promotes eCB release at vHPC-BLA synapses
* Active stress coping recruits vHPC-BLA eCB signaling
* vHPC-BLA CB1 receptor deletion exacerbates stress-induced avoidance/anhedonia

**Summary**

The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a key modulator of glutamate release within limbic neurocircuitry and thus heavily modulates stress responsivity and adaptation. The ventral hippocampus (vHPC)-basolateral amygdala (BLA) circuit has been implicated in the expression of negative affective states following stress exposure and is modulated by retrograde eCB signaling. However, the mechanisms governing eCB release and the causal relationship between vHPC-BLA eCB signaling and stress-induced behavioral adaptations are not known. Here, we utilized in vivo optogenetic- and biosensor-based approaches to determine the temporal dynamics of activity-dependent and stress-induced eCB release at vHPC-BLA synapses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that genetic deletion of cannabinoid type-1 receptors selectively at vHPC-BLA synapses decreases active stress coping and exacerbates stress-induced avoidance and anhedonia phenotypes. These data establish the in vivo determinants of eCB release at limbic synapses and demonstrate that eCB signaling within vHPC-BLA circuitry serves to counteract adverse behavioral consequences of stress.

A critical period plasticity framework for the sensorimotor–association axis of cortical neurodevelopment,,"**Highlights**

Human neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that brain development progresses hierarchically along an S–A axis in which areas of association cortex are the last to mature.

Animal models delineate a hierarchical progression of critical periods of elevated experience-dependent plasticity across sensory systems which is governed by a conserved set of neurobiological mechanisms.

We propose that hierarchical development along the S–A axis in humans is driven by a cascade of critical periods that culminate in association cortices during adolescence.

We highlight advances in in vivo neuroimaging and computational approaches, including pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), chemogenetic fMRI, and biophysical modeling, that can provide insights into the development of critical period mechanisms along the S–A axis in humans.

**Abstract**  
To understand human brain development it is necessary to describe not only the spatiotemporal patterns of neurodevelopment but also the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie them. Human neuroimaging studies have provided evidence for a hierarchical sensorimotor-to-association (S–A) axis of cortical neurodevelopment. Understanding the biological mechanisms that underlie this program of development using traditional neuroimaging approaches has been challenging. Animal models have been used to identify periods of enhanced experience-dependent plasticity – 'critical periods' – that progress along cortical hierarchies and are governed by a conserved set of neurobiological mechanisms that promote and then restrict plasticity. In this review we hypothesize that the S–A axis of cortical development in humans is partly driven by the cascading maturation of critical period plasticity mechanisms. We then describe how recent advances in in vivo neuroimaging approaches provide a promising path toward testing this hypothesis by linking signals derived from non-invasive imaging to critical period mechanisms.",other,POSITIVE,0.8272015452384949

Pou3f1 orchestrates a gene regulatory network controlling contralateral retinogeniculate projections,,"**Highlights**

* POU3F1 is expressed in postmitotic RGC precursors but downregulated in most mature RGCs
* Pou3f1 loss increases production of ipsilateral RGCs at the expense of contralateral RGCs
* POU3F1 represses ipsilateral determinants and activates contralateral determinants
* POU3F1 promotes RGC-like cell production when misexpressed in late progenitors

**Summary**  
The balance of contralateral and ipsilateral retinogeniculate projections is critical for binocular vision, but the transcriptional programs regulating this process remain ill defined. Here we show that the Pou class homeobox protein POU3F1 is expressed in nascent mouse contralateral retinal ganglion cells (cRGCs) but not ipsilateral RGCs (iRGCs). Upon Pou3f1 inactivation, the proportion of cRGCs is reduced in favor of iRGCs, leading to abnormal projection ratios at the optic chiasm. Conversely, misexpression of Pou3f1 in progenitors increases the production of cRGCs. Using CUT&RUN and RNA sequencing in gain- and loss-of-function assays, we demonstrate that POU3F1 regulates expression of several key members of the cRGC gene regulatory network. Finally, we report that POU3F1 is sufficient to induce RGC-like cell production, even in late-stage retinal progenitors of Atoh7 knockout mice. This work uncovers POU3F1 as a regulator of the cRGC transcriptional program, opening possibilities for optic nerve regenerative therapies.

Interaction of an α-synuclein epitope with HLA-DRB1∗15:01 triggers enteric features in mice reminiscent of prodromal Parkinson’s disease,,"**Highlights**

* α-syn32-46 immunization of HLA-DRB1∗15:01 mice triggers weight loss and constipation
* α-syn32-46 immunizations induce inflammation and neuron loss in the gut
* Depletion of CD4+, but not CD8+, T cells partially rescues enteric neural loss
* Both α-syn32-46 and HLA-DRB1∗15:01 are critical for this model of prodromal PD

**Summary**

Enteric symptoms are hallmarks of prodromal Parkinson’s disease (PD) that appear decades before the onset of motor symptoms and diagnosis. PD patients possess circulating T cells that recognize specific α-synuclein (α-syn)-derived epitopes. One epitope, α-syn32-46, binds with strong affinity to the HLA-DRB1∗15:01 allele implicated in autoimmune diseases. We report that α-syn32-46 immunization in a mouse expressing human HLA-DRB1∗15:01 triggers intestinal inflammation, leading to loss of enteric neurons, damaged enteric dopaminergic neurons, constipation, and weight loss. α-Syn32-46 immunization activates innate and adaptive immune gene signatures in the gut and induces changes in the CD4+ TH1/TH17 transcriptome that resemble tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells found in mucosal barriers during inflammation. Depletion of CD4+, but not CD8+, T cells partially rescues enteric neurodegeneration. Therefore, interaction of α-syn32-46 and HLA-DRB1∗15:0 is critical for gut inflammation and CD4+ T cell-mediated loss of enteric neurons in humanized mice, suggesting mechanisms that may underlie prodromal enteric PD.

Daam2 phosphorylation by CK2α negatively regulates Wnt activity during white matter development and injury,,"**Significance**  
Wnt signaling plays a vital role in oligodendrocyte (OL) development and has been implicated as an adverse event for myelin repair after white matter injury. Emerging studies have shed light on multimodal roles of Wnt effectors in the OL lineage, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and modifiable targets in OL remyelination remain unclear. Using genetic mouse development and injury model systems, we delineate a unique stage-specific function of Daam2 in Wnt signaling and OL development via a S704/T705 phosphorylation mechanism and determine a different role of the kinase CK2α in the regulation of OL development and myelin regeneration.

**Abstract**  
Wnt signaling plays an essential role in developmental and regenerative myelination in the central nervous system. The Wnt signaling pathway is composed of multiple regulatory layers; thus, how these processes are coordinated to orchestrate oligodendrocyte (OL) development remains unclear. Here, we show CK2α, a Wnt/β-catenin signaling Se[REDACTED] kinase, phosphorylates Daam2, inhibiting its function and Wnt activity during OL development. Intriguingly, we found Daam2 phosphorylation differentially impacts distinct stages of OL development, accelerating early differentiation followed by decelerating maturation and myelination. Application toward white matter injury revealed CK2α-mediated Daam2 phosphorylation plays a protective role for developmental and behavioral recovery after neonatal hypoxia, while promoting myelin repair following adult demyelination. Together, our findings identify a unique regulatory node in the Wnt pathway that regulates OL development via protein phosphorylation-induced signaling complex instability and highlights a new biological mechanism for myelin restoration.",other,NEGATIVE,0.981334924697876

Here we show that N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent internal mRNA modification, is downregulated in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-differentiated neurons and postmortem brain tissues. The global m6A hypomethylation leads to transcriptome-wide mRNA stabilization and upregulated gene expression, particularly for genes involved in synaptic activity and neuronal function. Moreover, the m6A modification in the C9ORF72 intron sequence upstream of the expanded repeats enhances RNA decay via the nuclear reader YTHDC1, and the antisense RNA repeats can also be regulated through m6A modification. The m6A reduction increases the accumulation of repeat RNAs and the encoded poly-dipeptides, contributing to disease pathogenesis. We further demonstrate that, by elevating m6A methylation, we could significantly reduce repeat RNA levels from both strands and the derived poly-dipeptides, rescue global mRNA homeostasis and improve survival of C9ORF72-ALS/FTD patient iPSC-derived neurons.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9849712252616882

PIEZO2 in somatosensory neurons controls gastrointestinal transit,,"**Highlights**

* Individuals with PIEZO2 syndrome present impaired bowel sensation and GI dysfunction
* Piezo2 in DRG neurons plays an important role in regulating gut motility
* Lack of Piezo2 from sensory neurons accelerates gastric emptying and intestinal transit
* DRG neurons detect colon distension via Piezo2

**Summary**

The gastrointestinal tract is in a state of constant motion. These movements are tightly regulated by the presence of food and help digestion by mechanically breaking down and propelling gut content. Mechanical sensing in the gut is thought to be essential for regulating motility; however, the identity of the neuronal populations, the molecules involved, and the functional consequences of this sensation are unknown. Here, we show that humans lacking PIEZO2 exhibit impaired bowel sensation and motility. Piezo2 in mouse dorsal root, but not nodose ganglia is required to sense gut content, and this activity slows down food transit rates in the stomach, small intestine, and colon. Indeed, Piezo2 is directly required to detect colon distension in vivo. Our study unveils the mechanosensory mechanisms that regulate the transit of luminal contents throughout the gut, which is a critical process to ensure proper digestion, nutrient absorption, and waste removal.

DRG afferents that mediate physiologic and pathologic mechanosensation from the distal colon,,"**Highlights**

* Five genetic subtypes of DRG sensory afferents innervate the distal colon
* These subtypes have diverse ending morphologies in the colon
* The responses of four subtypes to colon distension have distinct physiologic properties
* One subtype (Bmpr1b+) is hyper-reactive to colonic distension during inflammation

**Summary**

The properties of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons that innervate the distal colon are poorly defined, hindering our understanding of their roles in normal physiology and gastrointestinal (GI) disease. Here, we report genetically defined subsets of colon-innervating DRG neurons with diverse morphologic and physiologic properties. Four colon-innervating DRG neuron populations are mechanosensitive and exhibit distinct force thresholds to colon distension. The highest threshold population, selectively labeled using Bmpr1b genetic tools, is necessary and sufficient for behavioral responses to high colon distension, which is partly mediated by the mechanosensory ion channel Piezo2. This Aδ-HTMR population mediates behavioral over-reactivity to colon distension caused by inflammation in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, like cutaneous DRG mechanoreceptor populations, colon-innervating mechanoreceptors exhibit distinct anatomical and physiological properties and tile force threshold space, and genetically defined colon-innervating HTMRs mediate pathophysiological responses to colon distension, revealing a target population for therapeutic intervention.

Identification and targeting of a unique NaV1.7 domain driving chronic pain,,"**Significance**  
The voltage-gated sodium channel isoform 1.7 (NaV1.7) has been widely implicated in chronic pain. We have discovered a unique intracellular region of NaV1.7 that facilitates its regulation by intracellular auxiliary proteins and which can be targeted to ameliorate chronic pain. Targeting this sequence produces robust reversal of mechanical allodynia in preclinical models of nerve injury, as well as a model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. A plasmid coding for this sequence packaged inside a viral capsid reduced NaV1.7 current density and neuropathic pain. The translational utility of our approach is illustrated by the finding that our genetic therapy reduced NaV1.7 function in macaque DRG neurons, which shares complete sequence homology with human NaV1.7.

**Abstract**  
Small molecules directly targeting the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) NaV1.7 have not been clinically successful. We reported that preventing the addition of a small ubiquitin-like modifier onto the NaV1.7-interacting cytosolic collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) blocked NaV1.7 function and was antinociceptive in rodent models of neuropathic pain. Here, we discovered a CRMP2 regulatory sequence (CRS) unique to NaV1.7 that is essential for this regulatory coupling. CRMP2 preferentially bound to the NaV1.7 CRS over other NaV isoforms. Substitution of the NaV1.7 CRS with the homologous domains from the other eight VGSC isoforms decreased NaV1.7 currents. A cell-penetrant decoy peptide corresponding to the NaV1.7-CRS reduced NaV1.7 currents and trafficking, decreased presynaptic NaV1.7 expression, reduced spinal CGRP release, and reversed nerve injury-induced mechanical allodynia. Importantly, the NaV1.7-CRS peptide did not produce motor impairment, nor did it alter physiological pain sensation, which is essential for survival. As a proof-of-concept for a NaV1.7 -targeted gene therapy, we packaged a plasmid encoding the NaV1.7-CRS in an AAV virus. Treatment with this virus reduced NaV1.7 function in both rodent and rhesus macaque sensory neurons. This gene therapy reversed and prevented mechanical allodynia in a model of nerve injury and reversed mechanical and cold allodynia in a model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. These findings support the conclusion that the CRS domain is a targetable region for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.",other,NEGATIVE,0.7832894921302795

The human milk component myo-inositol promotes neuronal connectivity,,"Yes, I am the first author on this publication. Posting here to solicit feedback (including constructive criticism), answer questions, and gather perspectives on the results my colleagues and I worked rigorously to obtain.  


[Fig 1](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2221413120)

**Abstract:**  
Effects of micronutrients on brain connectivity are incompletely understood. Analyzing human milk samples across global populations, we identified the carbocyclic sugar myo-inositol as a component that promotes brain development. We determined that it is most abundant in human milk during early lactation when neuronal connections rapidly form in the infant brain. Myo-inositol promoted synapse abundance in human excitatory neurons as well as cultured rat neurons and acted in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, myo-inositol enhanced the ability of neurons to respond to transsynaptic interactions that induce synapses. Effects of myo-inositol in the developing brain were tested in mice, and its dietary supplementation enlarged excitatory postsynaptic sites in the maturing cortex. Utilizing an organotypic slice culture system, we additionally determined that myo-inositol is bioactive in mature brain tissue, and treatment of organotypic slices with this carbocyclic sugar increased the number and size of postsynaptic specializations and excitatory synapse density. This study advances our understanding of the impact of human milk on the infant brain and identifies myo-inositol as a breast milk component that promotes the formation of neuronal connections.

Direct activation of KCC2 arrests benzodiazepine refractory status epilepticus and limits the subsequent neuronal injury in mice,,"[**Graphical abstract**](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2666379123000496-fx1_lrg.jpg)

**Highlights**

* Identification of small molecules that bind to and activate KCC2
* Activation of KCC2 reduces neuronal Cl− accumulation
* KCC2 activation restores the efficacy of benzodiazepine to arrest seizures
* KCC2 activation reduces neuronal death following seizures

**Summary**

Hyperpolarizing GABAAR currents, the unitary events that underlie synaptic inhibition, are dependent upon efficient Cl− extrusion, a process that is facilitated by the neuronal specific K+/Cl− co-transporter KCC2. Its activity is also a determinant of the anticonvulsant efficacy of the canonical GABAAR-positive allosteric: benzodiazepines (BDZs). Compromised KCC2 activity is implicated in the pathophysiology of status epilepticus (SE), a medical emergency that rapidly becomes refractory to BDZ (BDZ-RSE). Here, we have identified small molecules that directly bind to and activate KCC2, which leads to reduced neuronal Cl− accumulation and excitability. KCC2 activation does not induce any overt effects on behavior but prevents the development of and terminates ongoing BDZ-RSE. In addition, KCC2 activation reduces neuronal cell death following BDZ-RSE. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that KCC2 activation is a promising strategy to terminate BDZ-resistant seizures and limit the associated neuronal injury.

Organizing memories for generalization in complementary learning systems,,"The Abstract: ""Memorization and generalization are complementary cognitive processes that jointly promote adaptive behavior. For example, animals should memorize safe routes to specific water sources and generalize from these memories to discover environmental features that predict new ones. These functions depend on systems consolidation mechanisms that construct neocortical memory traces from hippocampal precursors, but why systems consolidation only applies to a subset of hippocampal memories is unclear. Here we introduce a new neural network formalization of systems consolidation that reveals an overlooked tension—unregulated neocortical memory transfer can cause overfitting and harm generalization in an unpredictable world. We resolve this tension by postulating that memories only consolidate when it aids generalization. This framework accounts for partial hippocampal–cortical memory transfer and provides a normative principle for reconceptualizing numerous observations in the field. Generalization-optimized systems consolidation thus provides new insight into how adaptive behavior benefits from complementary learning systems specialized for memorization and generalization.""",other,POSITIVE,0.9924278855323792

**Summary**  
Preclinical and clinical studies implicate endocannabinoids (eCBs) in fear extinction, but the underlying neural circuit basis of these actions is unclear. Here, we employed in vivo optogenetics, eCB biosensor imaging, ex vivo electrophysiology, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in mice to examine whether basolateral amygdala (BLA)-projecting medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons represent a neural substrate for the effects of eCBs on extinction. We found that photoexcitation of mPFC axons in BLA during extinction mobilizes BLA eCBs. eCB biosensor imaging showed that eCBs exhibit a dynamic stimulus-specific pattern of activity at mPFC→BLA neurons that tracks extinction learning. Furthermore, using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing, we demonstrated that extinction memory formation involves eCB activity at cannabinoid CB1 receptors expressed at vmPFC→BLA synapses. Our findings reveal the temporal characteristics and a neural circuit basis of eCBs’ effects on fear extinction and inform efforts to target the eCB system as a therapeutic approach in extinction-deficient neuropsychiatric disorders.",other,NEGATIVE,0.982631266117096

Postsynaptic synucleins mediate endocannabinoid signaling,,"**Abstract**  
Endocannabinoids are among the most powerful modulators of synaptic transmission throughout the nervous system, and yet little is understood about the release of endocannabinoids from postsynaptic compartments. Here we report an unexpected finding that endocannabinoid release requires synucleins, key contributors to Parkinson’s disease. We show that endocannabinoids are released postsynaptically by a synuclein-dependent and SNARE-dependent mechanism. Specifically, we found that synuclein deletion blocks endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic plasticity; this block is reversed by postsynaptic expression of wild-type but not of mutant α-synuclein. Whole-cell recordings and direct optical monitoring of endocannabinoid signaling suggest that the synuclein deletion specifically blocks endocannabinoid release. Given the presynaptic role of synucleins in regulating vesicle lifecycle, we hypothesize that endocannabinoids are released via a membrane interaction mechanism. Consistent with this hypothesis, postsynaptic expression of tetanus toxin light chain, which cleaves synaptobrevin SNAREs, also blocks endocannabinoid-dependent signaling. The unexpected finding that endocannabinoids are released via a synuclein-dependent mechanism is consistent with a general function of synucleins in membrane trafficking and adds a piece to the longstanding puzzle of how neurons release endocannabinoids to induce synaptic plasticity.",other,NEGATIVE,0.8978270292282104

I’m considering the options I have: I will take out student loans once I’m a permanent resident, and start anew at another college/university in Biology/Cognitive Science as a part time student. Then with decent grades I will try to go into research. Doing all of this while working full time it’s a heavy workload, and I do have the tendency to overload myself.

Hi everyone

I am currently an undergrad at Penn State University who lacks clarity on the specifics of my long term goals.

For the past few years, I’ve had these very crude visions of what I want my legacy to be, and while I feel unsure about the specifics, I have a general sense of what I want to do.

Basically, I want to develop and work with the technology used in non-invasive brain stimulation and use it to transform our dreams into therapeutic experiences.

[Here’s a great description of what I envision](https://youtu.be/RDVgfFzZVsA?t=4886)

I currently have plans to earn a B.S. in Computational Math with a Minor in Neuroscience and then pursue a graduate degree in Computational Neuro. 

That plan may seem perfectly plausible to someone as uneducated as myself, but I want to discuss the specifics of how my education will affect my future with people who have similar interests and have established themselves in the field (while I still can!)

If anyone can provide resources, connections, and/or guidance, I would be extremely grateful 🙏 

Thank you",other,NEGATIVE,0.9539993405342102

Nav1.7 is essential for nociceptor action potentials in the mouse in a manner independent of endogenous opioids,,"**Highlights**

* Penk (pro-enkephalin) is upregulated following induced removal of Nav1.7 in adult mice
* Penk upregulation in the DRG is specific for cLTMRs
* Analgesia observed after Nav1.7 removal is not driven by enkephalin overexpression
* Nav1.7 plays an essential role in the initiation of nociceptor action potentials

**Summary**

Loss-of-function mutations in Nav1.7, a voltage-gated sodium channel, cause congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) in humans, demonstrating that Nav1.7 is essential for the perception of pain. However, the mechanism by which loss of Nav1.7 results in insensitivity to pain is not entirely clear. It has been suggested that loss of Nav1.7 induces overexpression of enkephalin, an endogenous opioid receptor agonist, leading to opioid-dependent analgesia. Using behavioral pharmacology and single-cell RNA-seq analysis, we find that overexpression of enkephalin occurs only in cLTMR neurons, a subclass of sensory neurons involved in low-threshold touch detection, and that this overexpression does not play a role in the analgesia observed following genetic removal of Nav1.7. Furthermore, we demonstrate using laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) and in vivo electrophysiology that Nav1.7 function is required for the initiation of C-fiber action potentials (APs), which explains the observed insensitivity to pain following genetic removal or inhibition of Nav1.7.

Nav1.7 is essential for nociceptor action potentials in the mouse in a manner independent of endogenous opioids,,"If only there was more research about NaV1. 9, but sadly it's incredibly difficult to do it. I actually have a genetic mutation of NaV1. 9 causing a gain of function. The AP threshold in pain of receptors in the dorsal basal ganglia is much higher than usual, causing them to fire with very little to no stimuli. It's also believed to cause the same pain receptors to reset very fast. Because of that I suffer from primary erythromelalgia and small fiber neuropathy, as well as increased motility in my GI system. The best treatment for my pain is actually oxycodone. It has a high affinity with the kappa opioid receptor, which helps with peripheral pain. Though the main reason it works better than anything is because it helps block the pain receptors from firing. My doctors and I are basically experimenting with what to do since there's very little research and there's no other cases that we know of to use as a reference.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9986264705657959

Cell type-specific dissection of sensory pathways involved in descending modulation,,"**Highlights**

* The periaqueductal gray (PAG) and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) are critically important hubs in the endogenous analgesia pathway.
* Technological and conceptual advances have permitted the identification and targeting of neural ensembles in the PAG and RVM during complex behaviors, revealing that they divergently modulate distinct components of somatosensation.
* In vivo imaging, viral tracing, and molecular genetic manipulations have afforded a new layer of insight by characterizing the function of genetically defined neuronal populations within the PAG and RVM.
* How these identified pathways coordinate other autonomic, motivational, and defensive responses during ongoing nociception remains to be addressed in greater detail.
* Further investigations into the PAG and RVM in the descending modulation of nociception, itch, and other complex behaviors are ongoing.

**Abstract**

Decades of research have suggested that stimulation of supraspinal structures, such as the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), inhibits nocifensive responses to noxious stimulation through a process known as descending modulation. Electrical stimulation and pharmacologic manipulations of the PAG and RVM identified transmitters and neuronal firing patterns that represented distinct cell types. Advances in mouse genetics, in vivo imaging, and circuit tracing methods, in addition to chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches, allowed the characterization of the cells and circuits involved in descending modulation in further detail. Recent work has revealed the importance of PAG and RVM neuronal cell types in the descending modulation of pruriceptive as well as nociceptive behaviors, underscoring their roles in coordinating complex behavioral responses to sensory input. This review summarizes how new technical advances that enable cell type-specific manipulation and recording of neuronal activity have supported, as well as expanded, long-standing views on descending modulation.",other,POSITIVE,0.9698501229286194

Gut enterochromaffin cells drive visceral pain and anxiety (Free PDF),,"**Abstract:**  
Gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort is a hallmark of most gut disorders and represents an important component of chronic visceral pain. For the growing population afflicted by irritable bowel syndrome, GI hypersensitivity and pain persist long after tissue injury has resolved. Irritable bowel syndrome also exhibits a strong sex bias, afflicting women three times more than men. Here, we focus on enterochromaffin (EC) cells, which are rare excitable, serotonergic neuroendocrine cells in the gut epithelium. EC cells detect and transduce noxious stimuli to nearby mucosal nerve endings but involvement of this signalling pathway in visceral pain and attendant sex differences has not been assessed. By enhancing or suppressing EC cell function in vivo, we show that these cells are sufficient to elicit hypersensitivity to gut distension and necessary for the sensitizing actions of isovalerate, a bacterial short-chain fatty acid associated with GI inflammation. Remarkably, prolonged EC cell activation produced persistent visceral hypersensitivity, even in the absence of an instigating inflammatory episode. Furthermore, perturbing EC cell activity promoted anxiety-like behaviours which normalized after blockade of serotonergic signalling. Sex differences were noted across a range of paradigms, indicating that the EC cell–mucosal afferent circuit is tonically engaged in females. Our findings validate a critical role for EC cell–mucosal afferent signalling in acute and persistent GI pain, in addition to highlighting genetic models for studying visceral hypersensitivity and the sex bias of gut pain.

I am looking forward to potentially starting a PhD in neuroscience as early as this September or January (depending on if I meet the Fall application deadline). The lab I would be working in would be heavily involved in central nervous system neurophysiology and neuroplasticity with elements of behavioural testing to evaluate treatment outcomes.  


I know I want to do a PhD in neuroscience, that is not something I question, but I'm thinking ahead of potential fields and post-doc positions I could look into when I've finished my doctorate. One field that has consistently peaked my interest is in neurotechnology and possibly neuroprosthetics. The integration of technology with the nervous system is something that fascinates me and that I see a broad and exciting future in.  


Not that a ""no"" would change my decision to go for a PhD in neuroscience, but I'm curious: Is a neuroscience degree a sufficient background to get into such a field after PhD? I see a lot of people saying I should get a degree in engineering or computer sciences instead but knowing it is such an interdisciplinary field, I'm hoping there is room for neuroscientists (especially those trained in nervous system adaptability and behavioural/motor testing) to join a team within this field.

I'm thinking about pursuing a comp neuro PhD in between AI and neuroscience. I have a background in ECE/CS, and I have some experience in various ML projects, some involving neuroscience (ex. imaging projects in undergrad, neuro-inspired robotics in industry) as well as a few years of industry experience in a clinical trial for a neurodegenerative disease, that doesn't incorporate much ML, as well as leading an ML team for a nonprofit.  
My research goal would be to compare emerging AI models with neural activity (ex. examining correlations between imaging/recordings of the brain for a task and comparing those to representations in DL models), and if I find a useful decoding maybe thinking about its application in a BMI. Furthermore, it seems neural reward systems and representations may have a part to play in how we think about general intelligence which I'm just fascinated to explore.  
I'm curious as to how those with PhD's came to find their topic of research, and to what extent I need to have a better idea of what I'd research as I am applying: the above is where I'm at right now, and I'm not sure how much more I can specify before actually starting to do some research. I also have kind of a scattered background and no publications and I'm trying to figure out how to present a somewhat generalist background that hasn't been built in academia- if anyone else has/had a similar background, I'm eager to know how you dealt with that!",interest_in_research,NEGATIVE,0.9989473223686218

Walking naturally after spinal cord injury using a brain–spine interface,,"**Abstract**  
A spinal cord injury interrupts the communication between the brain and the region of the spinal cord that produces walking, leading to paralysis1,2. Here, we restored this communication with a digital bridge between the brain and spinal cord that enabled an individual with chronic tetraplegia to stand and walk naturally in community settings. This brain–spine interface (BSI) consists of fully implanted recording and stimulation systems that establish a direct link between cortical signals3 and the analogue modulation of epidural electrical stimulation targeting the spinal cord regions involved in the production of walking4,5,6. A highly reliable BSI is calibrated within a few minutes. This reliability has remained stable over one year, including during independent use at home. The participant reports that the BSI enables natural control over the movements of his legs to stand, walk, climb stairs and even traverse complex terrains. Moreover, neurorehabilitation supported by the BSI improved neurological recovery. The participant regained the ability to walk with crutches overground even when the BSI was switched off. This digital bridge establishes a framework to restore natural control of movement after paralysis.

Walking naturally after spinal cord injury using a brain–spine interface,,"Ugghhhh wish they waited three months longer to publish, curious if it was obvious that this method was plateauing also.  Also curious what this looks like without the prior implant and surgeries.  Nearly all BCI devices I'm aware of lose efficacy over time, whether due to electrode degradation, gross signal/morphology changes, or homeostatic adaptation, will be super interested in the longitudinal follow ups.

I find the whole realm of stimulation of any sort (and drugs) imparting significant behavioral/functional/cognitive modification a really fascinating insight into the mechanics of our nervous system.

Cell type specific transcriptomic differences in depression show similar patterns between males and females but implicate distinct cell types and genes,,"**Abstract**  
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, heterogenous, and potentially serious psychiatric illness. Diverse brain cell types have been implicated in MDD etiology. Significant sexual differences exist in MDD clinical presentation and outcome, and recent evidence suggests different molecular bases for male and female MDD. We evaluated over 160,000 nuclei from 71 female and male donors, leveraging new and pre-existing single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Cell type specific transcriptome-wide threshold-free MDD-associated gene expression patterns were similar between the sexes, but significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) diverged. Among 7 broad cell types and 41 clusters evaluated, microglia and parvalbumin interneurons contributed the most DEGs in females, while deep layer excitatory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursors were the major contributors in males. Further, the Mic1 cluster with 38% of female DEGs and the ExN10\_L46 cluster with 53% of male DEGs, stood out in the meta-analysis of both sexes.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9646077156066895

Acan downregulation in parvalbumin GABAergic cells reduces spontaneous recovery of fear memories,,"**Abstract**  
While persistence of fear memories is essential for survival, a failure to inhibit fear in response to harmless stimuli is a feature of anxiety disorders. Extinction training only temporarily suppresses fear memory recovery in adults, but it is highly effective in juvenile rodents. Maturation of GABAergic circuits, in particular of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) cells, restricts plasticity in the adult brain, thus reducing PV+ cell maturation could promote the suppression of fear memories following extinction training in adults. Epigenetic modifications such as histone acetylation control gene accessibility for transcription and help couple synaptic activity to changes in gene expression. Histone deacetylase 2 (Hdac2), in particular, restrains both structural and functional synaptic plasticity. However, whether and how Hdac2 controls the maturation of postnatal PV+ cells is not well understood. Here, we show that PV+- cell specific Hdac2 deletion limits spontaneous fear memory recovery in adult mice, while enhancing PV+ cell bouton remodeling and reducing perineuronal net aggregation around PV+ cells in prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala. Prefrontal cortex PV+ cells lacking Hdac2, show reduced expression of Acan, a critical perineuronal net component, which is rescued by Hdac2 re-expression. Pharmacological inhibition of Hdac2 before extinction training is sufficient to reduce both spontaneous fear memory recovery and Acan expression in wild-type adult mice, while these effects are occluded in PV+-cell specific Hdac2 conditional knockout mice. Finally, a brief knock-down of Acan expression mediated by intravenous siRNA delivery before extinction training but after fear memory acquisition is sufficient to reduce spontaneous fear recovery in wild-type mice. Altogether, these data suggest that controlled manipulation of PV+ cells by targeting Hdac2 activity, or the expression of its downstream effector Acan, promotes the long-term efficacy of extinction training in adults.",other,NEGATIVE,0.995051920413971

Alleviation of thermal nociception depends on heat-sensitive neurons and a TRP channel in the brain,,"[**Graphical abstract**](https://www.cell.com/cms/attachment/f23be2e4-2e2c-4210-a20e-b52a22be1c6b/fx1_lrg.jpg)

**Highlights**

* Epi neurons are descending neurons in the brain that suppress thermal nociception
* A TRP channel (Painless) is required in Epi neurons to suppress thermal nociception
* Activation of Epi neurons by noxious heat depends on Painless
* Allatostatin C is a neuropeptide released by Epi neurons that reduces nociception

**Summary**

Acute avoidance of dangerous temperatures is critical for animals to prevent or minimize injury. Therefore, surface receptors have evolved to endow neurons with the capacity to detect noxious heat so that animals can initiate escape behaviors. Animals including humans have evolved intrinsic pain-suppressing systems to attenuate nociception under some circumstances. Here, using Drosophila melanogaster, we uncovered a new mechanism through which thermal nociception is suppressed. We identified a single descending neuron in each brain hemisphere, which is the center for suppression of thermal nociception. These Epi neurons, for Epione—the goddess of soothing of pain—express a nociception-suppressing neuropeptide Allatostatin C (AstC), which is related to a mammalian anti-nociceptive peptide, somatostatin. Epi neurons are direct sensors for noxious heat, and when activated they release AstC, which diminishes nociception. We found that Epi neurons also express the heat-activated TRP channel, Painless (Pain), and thermal activation of Epi neurons and the subsequent suppression of thermal nociception depend on Pain. Thus, while TRP channels are well known to sense noxious temperatures to promote avoidance behavior, this work reveals the first role for a TRP channel for detecting noxious temperatures for the purpose of suppressing rather than enhancing nociception behavior in response to hot thermal stimuli.

I’m majorly regretting it right now because I’m starting to realize that neuroscience is my main interest area. I would love to one day be able to research the science and treatment of epilepsy of unknown origin (i.e. no noticeable structural differences in an MRI or EEG differences). In particular I’m interested in investigating therapeutic options to treat epilepsy that aren’t as tranquilizing as many of the options today. 

In order to one day make real research contributions to this area, should I apply to more bachelors programs? Masters? PhD? Reach out to neuroscientists or neuro companies? Is it even possible to work on neuroscience research after undergrad if you haven’t studied it at all in school? 

I’ve talked to a lot of different neuroscientists and I do think I have a good personality for the field, I always get asked where I’m doing my residency and know I would have great bedside manner, etc. I’m feeling super regretful of my undergrad course of study and hope that it’s not too late to get into neuroscience.

To preface, I completely understand that expecting to make waves in such a technical field with a high-school level of experience is unreasonable, and I'm asking this question specifically to avoid falling into that trap.  
  
With that being said, I'm a junior in high school who's studied Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations and Introductory Linear Algebra, as well as \~1 year of experience in Python programming for mathematical modeling. I have experience independently studying subjects but wanted to get the experience of tackling real research problems, so I decided to look for topics in neuroscience as it's been one of my passions in STEM and I believed it would be more accessible in terms of feasible research projects. What are some recommended topics to look into for conducting research (beyond just writing a lit review)?  
  
Right now I'm focusing my search on experimental topics like a comparison of the neural anatomy and stimulus-response patterns of the kinesthetic and visual senses since I think a statistical analysis of raw data or the works would be easier to make meaningful progress with than advancing actual theory, but I'm not sure where to look or if this is even the right approach.

Microglia modulate general anesthesia through P2Y12 receptor,,"**Highlights**

* Microglial depletion accelerates anesthesia emergence
* Chemogenetic activation of microglia delays emergence from general anesthesia
* Microglial depletion impairs anesthesia-accompanying analgesia and hypothermia
* Ablation of microglial P2Y12R promotes anesthetic recovery

**Summary**  
General anesthesia (GA) is an unconscious state produced by anesthetic drugs, which act on neurons to cause overall suppression of neuronal activity in the brain. Recent studies have revealed that GA also substantially enhances the dynamics of microglia, the primary brain immune cells, with increased process motility and territory surveillance. However, whether microglia are actively involved in GA modulation remains unknown. Here, we report a previously unrecognized role for microglia engaging in multiple GA processes. We found that microglial ablation reduced the sensitivity of mice to anesthetics and substantially shortened duration of loss of righting reflex (LORR) or unconsciousness induced by multiple anesthetics, thereby promoting earlier emergence from GA. Microglial repopulation restored the regular anesthetic recovery, and chemogenetic activation of microglia prolonged the duration of LORR. In addition, anesthesia-accompanying analgesia and hypothermia were also attenuated after microglial depletion. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses showed that anesthesia prominently affected the transcriptional levels of chemotaxis and migration-related genes in microglia. By pharmacologically targeting different microglial motility pathways, we found that blocking P2Y12 receptor (P2Y12R) reduced the duration of LORR of mice. Moreover, genetic ablation of P2Y12R in microglia also promoted quicker recovery in mice from anesthesia, verifying the importance of microglial P2Y12R in anesthetic regulation. Our work presents the first evidence that microglia actively participate in multiple processes of GA through P2Y12R-mediated signaling and expands the non-immune roles of microglia in the brain.

* Considerable and similar synapse proteome changes in SCZ and BP
* Core synaptic, mitochondrial, and ribosomal protein networks are reduced in SCZ/BP
* Increase in vesicle tethering-, trafficking- and autophagy-related protein networks

**Summary**

Synaptic dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BP). We use quantitative mass spectrometry to carry out deep, unbiased proteomic profiling of synapses purified from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 35 cases of SCZ, 35 cases of BP, and 35 controls. Compared with controls, SCZ and BP synapses show substantial and similar proteomic alterations. Network analyses reveal upregulation of proteins associated with autophagy and certain vesicle transport pathways and downregulation of proteins related to synaptic, mitochondrial, and ribosomal function in the synapses of individuals with SCZ or BP. Some of the same pathways are similarly dysregulated in the synaptic proteome of mutant mice deficient in Akap11, a recently discovered shared risk gene for SCZ and BP. Our work provides biological insights into molecular dysfunction at the synapse in SCZ and BP and serves as a resource for understanding the pathophysiology of these disorders.",other,NEGATIVE,0.7727217078208923

**Highlights**

* Xenotransplanted brain organoids as in vivo platform for studying human microglia (hMGs)
* hMGs gain human-specific transcriptomic signatures and assume in-vivo-like identities
* hMGs engage in surveilling the human brain environment and react to perturbations
* A patient-derived model reveals a brain-environment-induced immune response in autism

**Summary**

Microglia are specialized brain-resident macrophages that play crucial roles in brain development, homeostasis, and disease. However, until now, the ability to model interactions between the human brain environment and microglia has been severely limited. To overcome these limitations, we developed an in vivo xenotransplantation approach that allows us to study functionally mature human microglia (hMGs) that operate within a physiologically relevant, vascularized immunocompetent human brain organoid (iHBO) model. Our data show that organoid-resident hMGs gain human-specific transcriptomic signatures that closely resemble their in vivo counterparts. In vivo two-photon imaging reveals that hMGs actively engage in surveilling the human brain environment, react to local injuries, and respond to systemic inflammatory cues. Finally, we demonstrate that the transplanted iHBOs developed here offer the unprecedented opportunity to study functional human microglia phenotypes in health and disease and provide experimental evidence for a brain-environment-induced immune response in a patient-specific model of autism with macrocephaly.",other,NEGATIVE,0.7231864333152771

Differential ripple propagation along the hippocampal longitudinal axis,,"**Abstract**: Hippocampal ripples are highly synchronous neural events critical for memory consolidation and retrieval. A minority of strong ripples has been shown to be of particular importance in situations of increased memory demands. The propagation dynamics of strong ripples inside the hippocampal formation are, however, still opaque. 

We analyzed ripple propagation within the hippocampal formation in a large open-access dataset comprising 267 Neuropixel recordings in 49 awake, head-fixed mice. Surprisingly, strong ripples (top 10% in ripple strength) propagate differentially depending on their generation point along the hippocampal longitudinal axis. 

The septal hippocampal pole is able to generate longer ripples that engage more neurons and elicit spiking activity for an extended time even at considerable distances. Accordingly, a substantial portion of the variance in strong ripple duration (R² = 0.463) is explained by the ripple generation location on the longitudinal axis, in agreement with a possible distinctive role of the hippocampal septal pole in conditions of high-memory demand. 

Moreover, we observed that the location of the ripple generation has a significant impact on the spiking rate modulation of different hippocampal subfields, even before the onset of the ripple. This finding suggests that ripple generation location plays a crucial role in shaping the neural activity across the hippocampus.

Differential ripple propagation along the hippocampal longitudinal axis,,"The mentioned study focuses on hippocampal ripples, which are brief oscillatory events detected in the local field potential (LFP) of the hippocampal formation. These events involve synchronized depolarization of a significant number of neurons in different regions of the hippocampus. The occurrence of ripples during memory encoding and retrieval is associated with improved recall performance. Ripples also play a role in memory consolidation during wakefulness and sleep.

The duration of ripples follows a skewed distribution, with a minority being long-duration ripples. In memory-demanding tasks and novel contexts, there is an increase in the fraction of long-duration ripples, ripple amplitude, and firing rate of excitatory and inhibitory neurons within the ripples. Manipulating ripple duration artificially affects working memory performance, with shorter durations leading to degraded performance and prolonged durations resulting in beneficial effects.

The study also highlights the importance of hippocampal-neocortical interactions for memory consolidation, particularly during long-duration ripples. Ripple amplitude and duration are correlated and related to the underlying spiking activity. Strong ripples, characterized by high strength, seem to play a specific role in situations with high mnemonic demand, suggesting a power law distribution where a minority of ripples contributes significantly to memory requirements.

The research aims to investigate the electrophysiological characteristics of strong ripples, such as their propagation and generation along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. The hippocampus exhibits functional segmentation along its long axis due to varying connectivity with cortical and subcortical areas. This heterogeneity in connectivity likely impacts the activation of different brain areas and neuronal subgroups by ripples. The study utilizes a dataset from the Allen Institute to comprehensively analyze ripple features in the septal half of the hippocampus and sheds light on previously overlooked details of ripple propagation.",other,NEGATIVE,0.8649123311042786

Dissecting the Neural Circuitry for Pain Modulation and Chronic Pain: Insights from Optogenetics,,"**Abstract**  
Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage. The processing of pain involves complicated modulation at the levels of the periphery, spinal cord, and brain. The pathogenesis of chronic pain is still not fully understood, which makes the clinical treatment challenging. Optogenetics, which combines optical and genetic technologies, can precisely intervene in the activity of specific groups of neurons and elements of the related circuits. Taking advantage of optogenetics, researchers have achieved a body of new findings that shed light on the cellular and circuit mechanisms of pain transmission, pain modulation, and chronic pain both in the periphery and the central nervous system.

In this I’ll get a full-ride & I’ll be apart of this STEM learning community. Besides me there are 4 colored people in the program - this is entirely irrelevant, but just let’s you know, somewhat, where they stand. As I said, pretty much a state school. Research is a bit iffy and not as developed, there neuroscience program as a whole is only in its 3rd year.

2) The rich private school. They’ve only gave me a full-tuition scholarship for 4 years, which is $47,000. I’ll come up with around $8k just for room/board (not books or various other items included). I’m also in their honors program. The selectivity between the honors here and the one at the state school are roughly similar. Additionally, since I plan to do research to get a PhD they’ve been telling me, of course they would, that research at their institution is better for an undergraduate.

Comb jellies’ unique fused neurons challenge evolution ideas,,"Cool article and associated paper!

The question of ""How do organisms build representations of themselves"" is still (IMO) not understood at all, and the hyper focus on ""brains"" as the source of these representations has always been flawed.

I think in the end, Golgi may have a bit of renaissance (or even better just leave the past in the past and move forward) the more we learn about various intercellular signalling pathways.  

For most vertebrates, intercellular calcium signaling plausibly provides a base for whole body representations, meaning those representations begin locally and are combined into a map in the brain, rather than the brain being responsible for creating the representation from scratch.

Edit:  Tangentially related - [The unembodied metaphor: comprehension and production of tactile metaphors without somatosensation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2023.1144018/full).  Work like this suggests that even when unable to process somatosensory stimuli, the body level representation still exists as she is able to use other sensory systems to produce action.  At the very least, some construct of ""body"" exists independently of the fully embodied construct commonly assumed.  

Edit 2:  And tangentially to both, can multicellular organisms create representations and coordinate movement without a centrally coordinating system at all?  Turns out, yes - [This Animal’s Behavior Is Mechanically Programmed](https://www.quantamagazine.org/before-brains-mechanics-may-have-ruled-animal-behavior-20220316/).

Online adaptive group-wise sparse Penalized Recursive Exponentially Weighted N-way Partial Least Square for epidural intracranial BCI,,"""Abstract  
Introduction: Motor Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) create new communication pathways between the brain and external effectors for patients with severe motor impairments. Control of complex effectors such as robotic arms or exoskeletons is generally based on the real-time decoding of high-resolution neural signals. However, high-dimensional and noisy brain signals pose challenges, such as limitations in the generalization ability of the decoding model and increased computational demands.  
Methods: The use of sparse decoders may offer a way to address these challenges. A sparsity-promoting penalization is a common approach to obtaining a sparse solution. BCI features are naturally structured and grouped according to spatial (electrodes), frequency, and temporal dimensions. Applying group-wise sparsity, where the coefficients of a group are set to zero simultaneously, has the potential to decrease computational time and memory usage, as well as simplify data transfer. Additionally, online closed-loop decoder adaptation (CLDA) is known to be an efficient procedure for BCI decoder training, taking into account neuronal feedback. In this study, we propose a new algorithm for online closed-loop training of group-wise sparse multilinear decoders using L p -Penalized Recursive Exponentially Weighted N-way Partial Least Square (PREW-NPLS). Three types of sparsity-promoting penalization were explored using L p with p = 0., 0.5, and 1.  
Results: The algorithms were tested offline in a pseudo-online manner for features grouped by spatial dimension. A comparison study was conducted using an epidural ECoG dataset recorded from a tetraplegic individual during long-term BCI experiments for controlling a virtual avatar (left/right-hand 3D translation). Novel algorithms showed comparable or better decoding performance than conventional REW-NPLS, which was achieved with sparse models. The proposed algorithms are compatible with real-time CLDA.  
Discussion: The proposed algorithm demonstrated good performance while drastically reducing the computational load and the memory consumption. However, the current study is limited to offline computation on data recorded with a single patient, with penalization restricted to the spatial domain only.

Sex-distinct microglial activation and myeloid cell infiltration in the spinal cord after painful peripheral injury,,"**Highlights**

* Spinal cord microglial activation, characterized by increases in Iba1 and TMEM119 expression, occurs in both male and female mice, with a delayed time course of activation in females.
* TMEM119, a microglial-specific marker, is not stably expressed in the spinal cord in the context of peripheral injury, and in fact increases to a similar degree as Iba1 after injury.
* Limited numbers of Iba1+TMEM119− cells were identified in the spinal cord after peripheral injury and these infiltrating myeloid lineage cells represented two unique cell populations: Ly6G + neutrophils and Ly6G- macrophages/monocytes.
* Spinal cord resident TMEM119+ microglia are the primary cellular source of CNS cytokines, IL6 and IL1β, released after peripheral injury.  
  
**Abstract**

Chronic pain is a common and often debilitating problem that affects 100 million Americans. A better understanding of pain’s molecular mechanisms is necessary for developing safe and effective therapeutics. Microglial activation has been implicated as a mediator of chronic pain in numerous preclinical studies; unfortunately, translational efforts using known glial modulators have largely failed, perhaps at least in part due to poor specificity of the compounds pursued, or an incomplete understanding of microglial reactivity. In order to achieve a more granular understanding of the role of microglia in chronic pain as a means of optimizing translational efforts, we utilized a clinically-informed mouse model of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and monitored microglial activation throughout pain progression. We discovered that while both males and females exhibit spinal cord microglial activation as evidenced by increases in Iba1, activation is attenuated and delayed in females. We further evaluated the expression of the newly identified microglia-specific marker, TMEM119, and identified two distinct populations in the spinal cord parenchyma after peripheral injury: TMEM119+ microglia and TMEM119- infiltrating myeloid lineage cells, which are comprised of Ly6G + neutrophils and Ly6G- macrophages/monocytes. Neurons are sensitized by inflammatory mediators released in the CNS after injury; however, the cellular source of these cytokines remains somewhat unclear. Using multiplex in situ hybridization in combination with immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that spinal cord TMEM119+ microglia are the cellular source of cytokines IL6 and IL1β after peripheral injury. Taken together, these data have important implications for translational studies: 1) microglia remain a viable analgesic target for males and females, so long as duration after injury is considered; 2) the analgesic properties of microglial modulators are likely at least in part related to their suppression of microglial-released cytokines, and 3) a limited number of neutrophils and macrophages/monocytes infiltrate the spinal cord after peripheral injury but have unknown impact on pain persistence or resolution. Further studies to uncover glial-targeted therapeutic interventions will need to consider sex, timing after injury, and the exact target population of interest to have the specificity necessary for translation.operties as well as pave the way for potential future gene therapies for chronic pain.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9879908859729767

Fatty acid amide hydrolase levels in brain linked with threat-related amygdala activation,,"**Abstract:**  
*Background*  
Preclinical evidence suggests that increasing levels of the major endocannabinoid anandamide decreases anxiety and fear responses potentially through its effects in the amygdala. Here we used neuroimaging to test the hypothesis that lower fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the main catabolic enzyme for anandamide, is associated with a blunted amygdala response to threat.  
  
*Methods*  
Twenty-eight healthy participants completed a positron emission tomography (PET) scan with the radiotracer for FAAH, \[11C\]CURB, as well as a block-design functional magnetic resonance imaging session during which angry and fearful faces meant to activate the amygdala were presented.  
  
*Results*  
\[11C\]CURB binding in the amygdala as well as in the medial prefrontal cortex, cingulate and hippocampus correlated positively with blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal during processing of angry and fearful faces (pFWE < 0.05).  
  
*Conclusion*  
Our finding that lower levels of FAAH in amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, cingulate and hippocampus was associated with a dampened amygdala response to a threatening social cue aligns with preclinical and neuroimaging studies in humans and suggests the involvement of FAAH in modulating stress and anxiety in humans. The current neuroimaging study also lends support for the potential use of FAAH inhibitors to control amygdala hyperactivity, which is known to be involved in the pathophysiology of anxiety and trauma-related disorders.

"The emerging science of Glioception: Contribution of glia in sensing, transduction, circuit integration of interoception",,"**Abstract**: Interoception is the process by which the nervous system regulates internal functions to achieve homeostasis. The role of neurons in interoception has received considerable recent attention, but glial cells also contribute. 

Glial cells can sense and transduce signals including osmotic, chemical, and mechanical status of extracellular milieu. Their ability to dynamically communicate “listening” and “talking” to neurons is necessary to monitor and regulate homeostasis and information integration in the nervous system. 

This review introduces the concept of “Glioception” and focuses on the process by which glial cells sense, interpret and integrate information about the inner state of the organism. 

Glial cells are ideally positioned to act as sensors and integrators of diverse interoceptive signals and can trigger regulatory responses via modulation of the activity of neuronal networks, both in physiological and pathological conditions. 

We believe that understanding and manipulating glioceptive processes and underlying molecular mechanisms provide a key path to develop new therapies for the prevention and alleviation of devastating interoceptive dysfunctions, among which pain is emphasized here with more focused details.

**Commentary**: I'm not sure if the term ""glioception"" is going to set the world on fire, but the conceit itself is essentially the same role for glia as we've understood for a few decades now.

The traditional view of glia managing homeostasis in a support role is Kandel level, and most should have been exposed to the conceit. This conceit only requires shifting active control of homeostasis from neurons to glia.

This sparked the idea that part of the reason the field has had so much experimental success with neurons over the past 50 years is because they are largely agnostic to input, and because of that can readily replicate any consistent experimental condition.  

It also seems consistent the challenge in describing system level behavior in vivo comes from this flip flopping of roles, we've been abstracting the active control unit behavior by watching the flow of relays.",curiosity_in_advancements,NEGATIVE,0.7730275988578796

Astrocytes mediate cell non-autonomous correction of aberrant firing in human FXS neurons,,"**Summary**: Pre-clinical studies of fragile X syndrome (FXS) have focused on neurons, with the role of glia remaining largely underexplored. 

We examined the astrocytic regulation of aberrant firing of FXS neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells. Human FXS cortical neurons, co-cultured with human FXS astrocytes, fired frequent short-duration spontaneous bursts of action potentials compared with less frequent, longer-duration bursts of control neurons co-cultured with control astrocytes. 

Intriguingly, bursts fired by FXS neurons co-cultured with control astrocytes are indistinguishable from control neurons. Conversely, control neurons exhibit aberrant firing in the presence of FXS astrocytes. 

Thus, the astrocyte genotype determines the neuronal firing phenotype. Strikingly, astrocytic-conditioned medium, and not the physical presence of astrocytes, is capable of determining the firing phenotype. 

The mechanistic basis of this effect indicates that the astroglial-derived protein, S100β, restores normal firing by reversing the suppression of a persistent sodium current in FXS neurons.

**Commentary**: This article continues in the same vein as the last few days, illustrating how glial control of the extra-cellular environment drive nervous system function.

Fragile X Syndrome is a syndromic (genetic) condition which usually results in decreased cognitive capacity on a sex dependent basis.  Etiologically, individuals will under-produce a critical mRNA (FMRP).  FMRP is well studied in tumo[REDACTED] work as a protein which deactivates immune system safeguards.

In the context of Fragile X syndrome, lack of FMRP production may reduce the ability to write information to synapses by creating an overactive immune system (microglial) response to newly modified glia/neurons.  

One of the most significant aspects of this work is it's one of the first that I've seen which clearly demonstrates that neuronal firing patterns are directly controlled by the phenotypical properties of local group astrocytes.

The traditional view of nervous system function dictates that neuronal morphology and phenotypical properties largely determine the firing properties of neurons.

This work provides clear evidence that neuronal firing is largely agnostic to stimuli and is shaped by glial influences instead.  It goes on to demonstrate that the electrophysical properties of a neuron are determined by the phenotypical presentation of connected astrocytes.

This represents a significant reshuffling of our understanding of nervous system processes, and adds to the growing evidence that astrocytes lie at the center of an ""information system"", which combines interactions from several classes of cells to generate cognitive states.

As a slight digression, the S100b biomarker explored in this work is IMO, a biomarker that we should be measuring as part of standard medical workups.  S100b is a biomarker which could provide significant early warning for nearly all neurogenerative conditions, including dementias.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9740059673786163

Astrocytic chloride is brain state dependent and modulates inhibitory neurotransmission in mice,,"**Abstract**: Information transfer within neuronal circuits depends on the balance and recurrent activity of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Chloride (Cl−) is the major central nervous system (CNS) anion mediating inhibitory neurotransmission. 

Astrocytes are key homoeostatic glial cells populating the CNS, although the role of these cells in regulating excitatory-inhibitory balance remains unexplored. Here we show that astrocytes act as a dynamic Cl− reservoir regulating Cl− homoeostasis in the CNS. 

We found that intracellular chloride concentration ([Cl−]i) in astrocytes is high and stable during sleep. In awake mice astrocytic [Cl−]i is lower and exhibits large fluctuation in response to both sensory input and motor activity. Optogenetic manipulation of astrocytic [Cl−]i directly modulates neuronal activity during locomotion or whisker stimulation. 

Astrocytes thus serve as a dynamic source of extracellular Cl− available for GABAergic transmission in awake mice, which represents a mechanism for modulation of the inhibitory tone during sustained neuronal activity.  

**Commentary**: Until recently, the contribution of non-neuronal cells to nervous system function was very poorly explored.  The last decade particularly has introduced a significant amount of data which portrays a more complex participation of glial cells to organism cognition and arousal than previously understood.

This work adds to our understanding of how non-neuronal glial cells, particularly astrocytes, modify the extra-cellular environment to modulate circuit level transmission and ultimately modify both arousal and cognitive function in organisms.",other,POSITIVE,0.9533501267433167

Astrocytes: integrators of arousal state and sensory context,,"**Abstract**: The integration of external information with the internal state of the body is central to the survival of virtually every multicellular organism. 

However, a complete picture of the mechanisms that govern this process is lacking. 

In this opinion article, we synthesize evidence demonstrating that astrocytes sense the momentary arousal state – through neuromodulator release – as well as the sensory inputs – through local synaptic activity – and respond to them with changes in calcium (Ca2+) signaling. 

We hypothesize that astrocytes integrate sensory signals with the internal state and that this process is necessary to secure optimal behavior. 

Finally, we argue that dysfunctional astrocytic Ca2+ signaling could be an underlying factor in disorders characterized by disrupted sensory processing.

**Commentary**: Until recently, the vast majority of our assumptions about the function of nervous systems has been derived from electrophysical data.  Glial participation in cognitive/conscious processing was largely invisible because it uses processes other than the expected electrochemical gradients to calculate our world.

Recent evidence suggests that not only do glia (and particularly astrocytes) participate strongly in organism behavior and perception of the world, they may be the primary driver of that experience.  

This article offers an opinion on why glia may be the critical bridge between our external sensory world and our internal response to that stimuli.",interest_in_research,NEGATIVE,0.6457353830337524

Brain-Computer interface control of stepping from invasive electrocorticography upper-limb motor imagery in a patient with quadriplegia,,"""Abstract  
Introduction: Most spinal cord injuries (SCI) result in lower extremities paralysis, thus diminishing ambulation. Using brain-computer interfaces (BCI), patients may regain leg control using neural signals that actuate assistive devices. Here, we present a case of a subject with cervical SCI with an implanted electrocorticography (ECoG) device and determined whether the system is capable of motor-imagery-initiated walking in an assistive ambulator. Methods: A 24-year-old male subject with cervical SCI (C5 ASIA A) was implanted before the study with an ECoG sensing device over the sensorimotor hand region of the brain. The subject used motor-imagery (MI) to train decoders to classify sensorimotor rhythms. Fifteen sessions of closed-loop trials followed in which the subject ambulated for one hour on a robotic-assisted weight-supported treadmill one to three times per week. We evaluated the stability of the best-performing decoder over time to initiate walking on the treadmill by decoding upper-limb (UL) MI. Results: An online bagged trees classifier performed best with an accuracy of 84.15% averaged across 9 weeks. Decoder accuracy remained stable following throughout closed-loop data collection. Discussion: These results demonstrate that decoding UL MI is a feasible control signal for use in lower-limb motor control. Invasive BCI systems designed for upper-extremity motor control can be extended for controlling systems beyond upper extremity control alone. Importantly, the decoders used were able to use the invasive signal over several weeks to accurately classify MI from the invasive signal. More work is needed to determine the long-term consequence between UL MI and the resulting lower-limb control.""",other,NEGATIVE,0.9972477555274963

I’m currently enrolled at Penn State pursuing a BS in Computational Math with a minor in Neuroscience.

I have aspirations to help advance treatment of mental disorders/disabilities, and the type of treatment I’m most excited for is the use of brain stimulation — particularly non-invasive brain stimulation.

I really want to push the boundaries of what is possible through non-invasive measures, so I was wondering…

Would a graduate degree in Computational Neuroscience make sense for someone like me who wants to work toward this future?

And also another question that can be considered somewhat separately from the first:

How much in the field of Computational Neuroscience is applied to real-world studies/scenarios?
Is it highly theoretical?

And In what other subfields are the concepts from Comp Neuro applied?

We investigated the prefrontal dynamics of no-report binocular rivalry. We found that beta activity signifies percept stability, which is interrupted by content-agnostic low Frequency activity. An increase in low frequency power and number of nodes activated results in mesoscale ignition, which precedes the change in the content of consciousness. We show that the two competing neuronal ensembles which represent the two stimuli are differentially coupled to the phase of the low Frequency activity before a spontaneous switch. Finally, we  show that such antagonistic coupling between beta and low frequency also exists during resting state and remarkably displays dynamics similar to the distribution of predominance durations in multistable perception.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9693129658699036

Chemogenetic attenuation of cortical seizures in nonhuman primates,,"**Abstract**  
Epilepsy is a disorder in which abnormal neuronal hyperexcitation causes several types of seizures. Because pharmacological and surgical treatments occasionally interfere with normal brain function, a more focused and on-demand approach is desirable. Here we examined the efficacy of a chemogenetic tool—designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs)—for treating focal seizure in a nonhuman primate model. Acute infusion of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline into the forelimb region of unilateral primary motor cortex caused paroxysmal discharges with twitching and stiffening of the contralateral arm, followed by recurrent cortical discharges with hemi- and whole-body clonic seizures in two male macaque monkeys. Expression of an inhibitory DREADD (hM4Di) throughout the seizure focus, and subsequent on-demand administration of a DREADD-selective agonist, rapidly suppressed the wide-spread seizures. These results demonstrate the efficacy of DREADDs for attenuating cortical seizure in a nonhuman primate model.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9852324724197388

Persistent nociceptor hyperactivity as a painful evolutionary adaptation,,"**Highlights**

* Injury to the nervous system can generate chronic pain driven by persistent hyperactivity of nociceptors, sensory neurons specialized to detect damaging stimuli.
* Recent evidence argues against the near-universal assumption that persistent nociceptor hyperactivity and resulting chronic pain are always maladaptive.
* Widespread conservation of mechanisms of nociceptor function and hyperactivity are well documented, as well as distinct adaptations to divergent nociceptive needs.
* Persistent nociceptor hyperactivity could have evolved to drive painful hypervigilance during persistent physical impairment, enhancing survival by decreasing subsequent risk of predatory or aggressive attack.
* Differences between rodent and human nociceptors are consistent with the possibility that, during relatively recent evolution, nociceptors increased their susceptibility to persistent hyperactivity, increasing the propensity of humans to chronic pain.

**Abstract**

Chronic pain caused by injury or disease of the nervous system (neuropathic pain) has been linked to persistent electrical hyperactivity of the sensory neurons (nociceptors) specialized to detect damaging stimuli and/or inflammation. This pain and hyperactivity are considered maladaptive because both can persist long after injured tissues have healed and inflammation has resolved. While the assumption of maladaptiveness is appropriate in many diseases, accumulating evidence from diverse species, including humans, challenges the assumption that neuropathic pain and persistent nociceptor hyperactivity are always maladaptive. We review studies indicating that persistent nociceptor hyperactivity has undergone evolutionary selection in widespread, albeit selected, animal groups as a physiological response that can increase survival long after bodily injury, using both highly conserved and divergent underlying mechanisms.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9727814793586731

I live in the US. I graduated last year with a BA in Neuroscience and Psychology (and a minor in education and society). Since then, I've worked part time as a research assistant in a linguistics lab, full-time as a substitute teacher, and will start another part-time job in another linguistics lab. 

However, I'm starting to feel the pressure to find a ""real"" career. I don't find linguistics particularly interesting, I just knew about these labs and had the skills they needed (ASL, Spanish, experience with children). I don't know how to transfer my skills though. 

I don't know what someone does with a neuroscience degree other than med school. I always assumed my bachelor's would be just for fun and I'd go back for a teaching certificate, but every single teacher I've talked to told me not to do it (and i live in a city where teachers are well paid). I also recently fell in love, which motivated me to actually earn enough money to support myself and my future spouse lol. 

Basically, how do I find careers in neuroscience, ideally that pay well? What keywords can I search? What companies should I keep an eye on? Is there anything that could work with my current experience? 

Thanks for any advice",other,NEGATIVE,0.9905678629875183

Home-based brain–computer interface attention training program for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a feasibility trial,,"""Abstract

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent child neurodevelopmental disorder that is treated in clinics and in schools. Previous trials suggested that our brain–computer interface (BCI)-based attention training program could improve ADHD symptoms. We have since developed a tablet version of the training program which can be paired with wireless EEG headsets. In this trial, we investigated the feasibility of delivering this tablet-based BCI intervention at home. 

Methods 

Twenty children diagnosed with ADHD, who did not receive any medication for the preceding month, were randomised to receive the 8-week tablet-based BCI intervention either in the clinic or at home. Those in the home intervention group received instructions before commencing the program and got reminders if they were lagging on the training sessions. The ADHD Rating Scale was completed by a blinded clinician at baseline and at week 8. Adverse events were monitored during any contact with the child throughout the trial and at week 8. 

Results 

Children in both groups could complete the tablet-based intervention easily on their own with minimal support from the clinic therapist or their parents (at home). The intervention was safe with few reported adverse effects. Clinician-rated inattentive symptoms on the ADHD-Rating Scale reduced by 3.2 (SD 6.20) and 3.9 (SD 5.08) for the home-based and clinic-based groups respectively, suggesting that home-based intervention was comparable to clinic-based intervention. 

Conclusions 

This trial demonstrated that the tablet version of our BCI-based attention training program can be safely delivered to children in the comfort of their own home.""",other,NEGATIVE,0.9965779185295105

Pharmacological targeting of cognitive impairment in depression: recent developments and challenges in human clinical research,,"Outline of what they found works, not exhaustive:

**tl;dr:** depression is associated with cognitive impairment, but *very few* treatments for depression improve cognitive function

## Pharmacological agents targeting primary neurotransmission

-	SSRIs and SNRIs — insignificant or indirect effects, discounting vortioxetine
-	5-HTR modulators — 5-HT3 antagonist vortioxetine; 5-HT1A agonists buspirone/tandospirone with SSRI
-	Dopaminergic modulators — dopamine reuptake inhibitors, modafinil
-	NMDA antagonists, AMPAkines, and metabotropic glutamate receptor inhibitors — ketamine, memantine
-	Cholinesterase inhibitors— donepezil, but not galantamine; the former is a sigma-1 receptor agonist

## Beyond primary neurotransmission – novel clinical targets

-	neurosteroid dysregulation — dehydroepiandrosterone and pregnenolone
-	σ1R agonists — fluvoxamine and donepezil
-	melatonin + buspirone — cognitive function possibly via sleep improvement?
-	methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine — on par with antidepressants in efficacy, but has potential for adenine toxicity

Increased intrinsic and synaptic excitability of hypothalamic POMC neurons underlies chronic stress-induced behavioral deficits,,"Summary:

-	chronic stress changes the excitation/inhibition balance of POMC/AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, yielding anhedonia and depression
-	AgRP hyperpolarization decreases their firing rate, while POMC depolarization increases their firing rate
-	AgRP agonism or POMC antagonism have similar effects, preventing anhedonia and depression
-	the attributes of chronicity and unpredictability are key to stress-driven POMC hyperactivity, which results from decrease in GABAergic inputs, partially explained by the hyperpolarized AgRP neurons
-	ATP-sensitive potassium channel activation yields hyperpolarization of POMC neurons, whereas inhibition of calcium-dependent potassium currents yields POMC hyperactivity, which could plausibly play a role in the observed effects, but it’s not clear how chronic unpredictable stress affects these channels

Modulating the activity of human nociceptors with a SCN10A-promoter specific viral vector tool,,"**Highlights**

* The NaV1.8 promoter allows the targeting of mouse nociceptors.
* We designed a novel viral tool that drives expression of cargo specifically in human nociceptors.
* Our viral tool enables the selective silencing of human nociceptors.

**Abstract**  
Despite the high prevalence of chronic pain as a disease in our society, there is a lack of effective treatment options for patients living with this condition. Gene therapies using recombinant AAVs are a direct method to selectively express genes of interest in target cells with the potential of, in the case of nociceptors, reducing neuronal firing in pain conditions. We designed a recombinant AAV vector expressing cargos whose expression was driven by a portion of the SCN10A (Nav1.8) promoter, which is predominantly active in nociceptors. We validated its specificity for nociceptors in mouse and human dorsal root ganglia and showed that it can drive the expression of functional proteins. Our viral vector and promoter package drove the expression of both excitatory or inhibitory DREADDs in primary human DRG cultures and in whole cell electrophysiology experiments, increased or decreased neuronal firing, respectively. Taken together, we present a novel viral tool that drives expression of cargo specifically in human nociceptors. This will allow for future specific studies of human nociceptor properties as well as pave the way for potential future gene therapies for chronic pain.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9922658801078796

I have a BS and a doctorate (not an MD) in a clinical field, and I'd like to make a switch into neuroscience or neuropsychology (leaning more towards neuropsych).  I'm still in an exploratory phase, so my question is - how do I get started?  I've always been interested in studying neuroscience (since I has in high school), but for various reasons went to school for something else. I minored in psychology, have taken a few neuroscience-related courses in undergrad, and continued to learn on my own time, so I've discovered a few areas of interest.

  
I know in the long run I know I don't want to work in a lab (I enjoy interacting with people as part of my job, and want to do more patient care), but understand that research is an important component to move ahead.  At this point in life, it would make more sense to go back and do a master's/PhD, but usually they are more specialized and I don't know exactly what I would do it in - how can I figure that out?  Part of me really just wants to ""start over"" with my career and go back to undergrad to figure out exactly what I want to do within the field.  Are there accelerated or part-time bachelors programs (especially outside of the US, since doing it here would likely be cost prohibitive)?

Convergent actions of stress and stimulants via epigenetic regulation of neural circuitry,,"**Highlights**

* Stress and stimulant exposure can predispose similar behaviors, including impaired decision-making, cognitive inflexibility, and resilience to updating information; these are governed in part by the dorsal striatum.
* Epigenetic changes – such as DNA methylation, transposable element activity, and histone post-translational modifications – accumulate as stress or stimulant exposure is maintained from an acute to a chronic condition.
* Stress or stimulant-induced accumulation of epigenetic changes can potentiate differential gene regulation, altering immediate and future neuronal functions that include exposure-induced synaptic plasticity.
* Chronic epigenetic dysregulation of regulatory genes in the dorsal striatum may contribute to compulsivity and cognitive inflexibility phenotypes, which are among the hallmarks of anxiety and addiction.

**Abstract**  
The dorsal striatum integrates prior and current information to guide appropriate decision-making. Chronic stress and stimulant exposure interferes with decision-making, and can confer similar cognitive and behavioral inflexibilities. This review examines the literature on acute and chronic regulation of the epigenome by stress and stimulants. Recent evidence suggests that exposures to stress and stimulants share similarities in the manners in which they regulate the dorsal striatum epigenome through DNA methylation, transposable element activity, and histone post-translational modifications. These findings suggest that chronic stress and stimulant exposure leads to the accumulation of epigenetic modifications that impair immediate and future neuron function and activity. Such epigenetic mechanisms represent potential therapeutic targets for ameliorating convergent symptoms of stress and addiction.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9602411389350891

Cross-species transcriptomic atlas of dorsal root ganglia reveals species-specific programs for sensory function,,"Now this is cool work.

Edit:  Sorry guess I should have added the why from my perspective.  

This work provides evidence that both sensory processing and behavioral processing start outside of the ""brain"".  Not in a trivial ""relaying signals to the brain"" kind of way, but in a ""the entire nervous system processes stimuli and generates behavior"" kind of way.  

IMO, neuroscience is still far too obsessed with ""the brain"", and this narrow focus is hindering understanding of how nervous systems actually process information.

The last decade especially has started to push back against this with the acknowledgement that other areas of the nervous system have significant contributions to overall function.  

For example, the ""Gut-Brain Axis"" as a conceit has a significant amount of momentum behind it, and the ""Heart-Brain Axis"" is picking up steam.   I've even seen references to Kidney, Lungs, and Reproductive axes.  

Ultimately, once all of these get stacked up on top of each other, I think we will come to realize that the *entire* nervous system is ""brain"", rather than just the portion in our heads.  

Work like this which demonstrates, across ethological lines, that species level behavior starts outside of the brain and provides not only a great comparison and contrast of behavioral mechanics themselves, but give clear evidence to why neuroscience should view the nervous system as a complete unit, rather than just a ""brain with relays"".",other,NEGATIVE,0.9981088638305664

Touch neurons underlying dopaminergic pleasurable touch and sexual receptivity,,"**Highlights**

* Activation of Mrgprb4-lineage touch neurons induces lordosis-like posture
* Activation of Mrgprb4-lineage touch neurons is rewarding
* Mrgprb4-lineage touch neurons are required for female sexual receptivity
* Mrgprb4-lineage touch neurons engage dopaminergic neurons during social behavior

**Summary**  
Pleasurable touch is paramount during social behavior, including sexual encounters. However, the identity and precise role of sensory neurons that transduce sexual touch remain unknown. A population of sensory neurons labeled by developmental expression of the G protein-coupled receptor Mrgprb4 detects mechanical stimulation in mice. Here, we study the social relevance of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons and reveal that these neurons are required for sexual receptivity and sufficient to induce dopamine release in the brain. Even in social isolation, optogenetic stimulation of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons through the back skin is sufficient to induce a conditioned place preference and a striking dorsiflexion resembling the lordotic copulatory posture. In the absence of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons, female mice no longer find male mounts rewarding: sexual receptivity is supplanted by aggression and a coincident decline in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Together, these findings establish that Mrgprb4-lineage neurons initiate a skin-to-brain circuit encoding the rewarding quality of social touch.

I'm really failing to see any effect here...and their results seem to contradict each other. It looks like, if anything, they see decreased performance after outdoor exercise according to Figure 1, where they show they make more errors??? It looks like they maybe switched labels from Table 1 to Figure 1 for the mean errors made, or they subtracted incorrectly?!?! Either way, Figure 1 is extremely misleading. 

Also also, shouldn't the indoor exercise group have increased P300 values based on their citations? This is not what they show in figure 3, and makes me wonder about their experimental setup. It looks like what happened was the indoor exercise wasn't actually exercise and the outdoor exercise was actually possibly strenuous, which led to their results. 

Overall, this paper is highly questionable at best and should not have been published the way it is currently presented.

The Multifaceted Roles of KCC2 in Cortical Development,,"**Highlights**

KCC2 is a neuron-specific chloride-extruder that shapes cortical development.

Changes in the strength of GABAergic synapses brought about by up- and downregulation of Cl− extrusion by KCC2 exert a major effect on neuronal plasticity and network functions.

The structural interactions of the C terminus of KCC2 regulate signaling pathways involved in early neuronal survival, spinogenesis, and glutamatergic synaptic transmission.

The recently discovered tertiary and quaternary structures of KCC2 and other cation/chloride cotransporter (CCC) members provide first insights into their functions at an atomic level.

The multisite phosphorylation code of KCC2 controls its membrane expression and stability, as well as its intrinsic transport rate during development, plasticity, and disease.

KCC2 mutations linked to epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) disrupt both ion transport-dependent and -independent KCC2 functions, suggesting a novel molecular basis for CNS disorders related to the structural roles of KCC2.

KCC2, best known as the neuron-specific chloride-extruder that sets the strength and polarity of GABAergic currents during neuronal maturation, is a multifunctional molecule that can regulate cytoskeletal dynamics via its C-terminal domain (CTD). We describe the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the multiple functions of KCC2 and its splice variants, ranging from developmental apoptosis and the control of early network events to the formation and plasticity of cortical dendritic spines. The versatility of KCC2 actions at the cellular and subcellular levels is also evident in mature neurons during plasticity, disease, and aging. Thus, KCC2 has emerged as one of the most important molecules that shape the overall neuronal phenotype.",other,POSITIVE,0.9142059087753296

Automated hippocampal unfolding for morphometry and subfield segmentation with HippUnfold,,"Abstract:  
Like neocortical structures, the archicortical hippocampus differs in its folding patterns across individuals. Here, we present an automated and robust BIDS-App, HippUnfold, for defining and indexing individual-specific hippocampal folding in MRI, analogous to popular tools used in neocortical reconstruction. Such tailoring is critical for inter-individual alignment, with topology serving as the basis for homology. This topological framework enables qualitatively new analyses of morphological and laminar structure in the hippocampus or its subfields. It is critical for refining current neuroimaging analyses at a meso- as well as micro-scale. HippUnfold uses state-of-the-art deep learning combined with previously developed topological constraints to generate uniquely folded surfaces to fit a given subject’s hippocampal conformation. It is designed to work with commonly employed sub-millimetric MRI acquisitions, with possible extension to microscopic resolution. In this paper, we describe the power of HippUnfold in feature extraction, and highlight its unique value compared to several extant hippocampal subfield analysis methods.",other,POSITIVE,0.9179161190986633

Using optogenetics, chemogenetics, and pharmacology, we assessed the behavioral effects of their selective stimulation in a wide variety of conditions. We show that metabotropic Gq-linked stimulation of these C-afferents, through activation of native MrgprA3 receptors or DREADDs, evokes stereotypical pruriceptive rather than nocifensive behaviors. In contrast, fast ionotropic stimulation of these same neurons through light-gated cation channels or native ATP-gated P2X3 channels predominantly evokes nocifensive rather than pruriceptive responses. We conclude that C-afferents display intrinsic multimodality, and we provide evidence that optogenetic and chemogenetic interventions on the same neuronal populations can drive distinct behavioral outputs.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9596419334411621

Neuroprosthetics: from sensorimotor to cognitive disorders,,"Abstract  
Neuroprosthetics is a multidisciplinary field at the interface between neurosciences and biomedical engineering, which aims at replacing or modulating parts of the nervous system that get disrupted in neurological disorders or after injury. Although neuroprostheses have steadily evolved over the past 60 years in the field of sensory and motor disorders, their application to higher-order cognitive functions is still at a relatively preliminary stage. Nevertheless, a recent series of proof-of-concept studies suggest that electrical neuromodulation strategies might also be useful in alleviating some cognitive and memory deficits, in particular in the context of dementia. Here, we review the evolution of neuroprosthetics from sensorimotor to cognitive disorders, highlighting important common principles such as the need for neuroprosthetic systems that enable multisite bidirectional interactions with the nervous system.",other,POSITIVE,0.9552612900733948

Locus coeruleus activity improves cochlear implant performance - Nature,,"Abstract  
Cochlear implants (CIs) are neuroprosthetic devices that can provide hearing to deaf people1. Despite the benefits offered by CIs, the time taken for hearing to be restored and perceptual accuracy after long-term CI use remain highly variable2,3. CI use is believed to require neuroplasticity in the central auditory system, and differential engagement of neuroplastic mechanisms might contribute to the variability in outcomes4,5,6,7. Despite extensive studies on how CIs activate the auditory system4,8,9,10,11,12, the understanding of CI-related neuroplasticity remains limited. One potent factor enabling plasticity is the neuromodulator noradrenaline from the brainstem locus coeruleus (LC). Here we examine behavioural responses and neural activity in LC and auditory cortex of deafened rats fitted with multi-channel CIs. The rats were trained on a reward-based auditory task, and showed considerable individual differences of learning rates and maximum performance. LC photometry predicted when CI subjects began responding to sounds and longer-term perceptual accuracy. Optogenetic LC stimulation produced faster learning and higher long-term accuracy. Auditory cortical responses to CI stimulation reflected behavioural performance, with enhanced responses to rewarded stimuli and decreased distinction between unrewarded stimuli. Adequate engagement of central neuromodulatory systems is thus a potential clinically relevant target for optimizing neuroprosthetic device use.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9352409243583679

Deep brain stimulation by blood–brain-barrier-crossing piezoelectric nanoparticles generating current and nitric oxide under focused ultrasound - Nature Biomedical Engineering,,"Abstract
Deep brain stimulation via implanted electrodes can alleviate neuronal disorders. However, its applicability is constrained by side effects resulting from the insertion of electrodes into the brain. Here, we show that systemically administered piezoelectric nanoparticles producing nitric oxide and generating direct current under high-intensity focused ultrasound can be used to stimulate deep tissue in the brain. The release of nitric oxide temporarily disrupted tight junctions in the blood–brain barrier, allowing for the accumulation of the nanoparticles into brain parenchyma, and the piezoelectrically induced output current stimulated the release of dopamine by dopaminergic neuron-like cells. In a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease, the ultrasound-responsive nanoparticles alleviated the symptoms of the disease without causing overt toxicity. The strategy may inspire the development of other minimally invasive therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.",treatment_frustration,POSITIVE,0.7321327924728394

Rostral-middle locus coeruleus integrity and subjective cognitive decline in early old age,,"**Abstract**

**Objectives:**

Abnormal tau, a hallmark Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, may appear in the locus coeruleus (LC) decades before AD symptom onset. Reports of subjective cognitive decline are also often present prior to formal diagnosis. Yet, the relationship between LC structural integrity and subjective cognitive decline has remained unexplored. Here, we aimed to explore these potential associations.

**Methods:**

We examined 381 community-dwelling men (mean age = 67.58; SD = 2.62) in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging who underwent LC-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging and completed the Everyday Cognition scale to measure subjective cognitive decline along with their selected informants. Mixed models examined the associations between rostral-middle and caudal LC integrity and subjective cognitive decline after adjusting for depressive symptoms, physical morbidities, and family. Models also adjusted for current objective cognitive performance and objective cognitive decline to explore attenuation.

**Results:**

For participant ratings, lower rostral-middle LC contrast to noise ratio (LCCNR) was associated with significantly greater subjective decline in memory, executive function, and visuospatial abilities. For informant ratings, lower rostral-middle LCCNR was associated with significantly greater subjective decline in memory only. Associations remained after adjusting for current objective cognition and objective cognitive decline in respective domains.

**Conclusions:**

Lower rostral-middle LC integrity is associated with greater subjective cognitive decline. Although not explained by objective cognitive performance, such a relationship may explain increased AD risk in people with subjective cognitive decline as the LC is an important neural substrate important for higher order cognitive processing, attention, and arousal and one of the first sites of AD pathology.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9865717887878418

Is this pseudoscience or is there something to action potential (electric) interactions?,"A bit of background: I recently got into holonomic brain theory but quickly realized that it's not useful at best, pseudoscience at worst, and has been appropriated by New Age and conspiracy weirdos (even though the original creator, Pribram, was a major neuroscientist himself and not a crank).

One thing that did intrigue me though was the idea of ""holoscapes"" and ""dendritic nets"". Usually we think of neuron interaction (neurons send electrical signals to each varying by things like the number of neurons, the direction of the signal etc.) but the idea by Pribram is that the electrical signals themselves interact with each other (along dendritic nets and synapses).

These electrical interactions *themselves* are important (and not just how the neurons interacted). Pribram argues these are like interference waves, or how multiple waves come together to make one wave (an analogy is like how there's left and right stereo channels that play at the same time to make a coherent song).

Anyways is there anything to this? Has there been research on how action potentials interact beyond just their role in neuron interaction?","I'm in no way supporting holonomic brain theory or Pribram. I just want to present biophysical properties that could relate to certain concepts you mention.

On the discussion of ""electrical interactions"" between neurons other than the conventional method. Your description of the conventional neuronal interaction is:

>neurons send electrical signals to each varying by things like the number of neurons, the direction of the signal etc.

To discuss electrical signals specifically, I'd like to define the conventional electrical signal as anterograde propagation of an action potential (AP) down the main axon to then evoke a chemical signal (NT release) at the synapse. This is what everyone teaches for basic neuro courses. Many instructors present basic electrical signaling with 3 absolutes: 

1. APs are *always* propagated in an anterograde direction (soma to axon terminal via main axon). 
2. APs *always* travel down the main axon. Basic neuro teaching assigns dendrites as just receiving the chemical signals from other neurons. Finally, 
3. NTs are *always* released at the axon terminal to then send chemical signals to other neurons.

However, these absolutes are incorrect!

1. APs can retrogradely propagate (axon terminal to soma). The idea that APs can only travel in one direction comes from the fact that sodium channel inactivation occurs after an AP. APs are generated via sodium channel activation, so periods of sodium channel inactivation will prevent new APs from being generated. Therefore, the APs propagating in an anterograde fashion will result in sodium channel inactivation, thus preventing new APs from being generated at the axon terminal. \**However,* neurons do not fire all the time! There are silent periods in certain neuronal types where no APs are generated for anterograde propagation. This allows for sodium channel activation at the axon terminal (or anywhere along the axon for that matter) and retrograde propagation of APs, also referred to as antidromic conduction.
2. Speaking of antidromic conduction/retrograde propagation: APs have been shown to backpropagate into dendrites depending on the morphology of the neuron. This leads us to...
3. Dendritic backpropagation of APs can result in dendritic neurotransmitter release, and therefore chemical signaling to neighboring neurons *via dendrites*! Ex: Dopamine neurons are one population that is known for somatodendritic release of dopamine. Somatodendritic dopamine release can result in inhibition of neighboring dopamine neurons via D2 receptors, autoinhibition of the releasing neuron itself, or excitation of nearby GABA neurons via D1Rs. It's a fun unconventional tool for neurons to communicate.

>These electrical interactions themselves are important (and not just how the neurons interacted).

The final biophysical phenomenon I'll address hopefully touches on this point\^ you bring up. I'm conceptualizing this as the APs propagating through a neuron can itself affect the APs of neighboring neurons without needing a chemical signal (NT release). If that is what you are referring to, then, yes, APs/electrical signals in one neuron can be used to communicate with another neuron without NT release! You can look up specifics on **ephaptic coupling**, which is a mechanism where nearby neurons can communicate solely on electrical signals. Briefly, an AP being generated and propagated down one neuron (we'll call this neuron A) will change the extracellular ionic concentration. If neuron B is located close enough to neuron A, then the change in extracellular ionic concentration evoked by neuron A's AP will also affect the electrochemical gradient of neuron B. This is termed ephaptic coupling between 2 neurons.

Hope I didn't stray off-topic or get too nitty gritty in the details! I have too much fun talking electrophysiology :)",other,NEGATIVE,0.9060039520263672

Nervous systems do not use ""electricity"" (or electrochemical gradients) to 
""communicate"", they use physical particles which have physical effects, ""electricity"" being a product of those effects.

This is true of nearly all cells, whether bacterium or baboon.

A really important question that doesn't get asked often enough is ""How predictive is my model?"", especially when compared to the length of time the model has been adopted.  I haven't personally seen any neuron centric/electric brain model which is remotely predictive for even simple configurations like c. elegans.

A nociceptive neuronal ensemble in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex underlies pain chronicity,,"**Highlights**

* Acute nociceptive stimuli activate a neuronal ensemble in dmPFC
* dmPFC nociceptive ensemble shows elevated activity to noxious stimuli in chronic pain
* Prolonged activation of dmPFC nociceptive ensemble induces chronic pain-like behavior
* dmPFC nociceptive ensemble modulates pain-related downstream regions

**Summary**  
Pain chronicity involves unpleasant experience in both somatosensory and affective aspects, accompanied with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) neuroplastic alterations. However, whether specific PFC neuronal ensembles underlie pain chronicity remains elusive. Here we identify a nociceptive neuronal ensemble in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), which shows prominent reactivity to nociceptive stimuli. We observed that this ensemble shows distinct molecular characteristics and is densely connected to pain-related regions including basolateral amygdala (BLA) and lateral parabrachial nuclei (LPB). Prolonged chemogenetic activation of this nociceptive neuronal ensemble, but not a randomly transfected subset of dmPFC neurons, induces chronic pain-like behaviors in normal mice. By contrast, silencing the nociceptive dmPFC neurons relieves both pain hypersensitivity and anxiety in mice with chronic inflammatory pain. These results suggest the presence of specific dmPFC neuronal ensembles in processing nociceptive information and regulating pain chronicity.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9657570123672485

I think this set the stage for the flood of glia focused work in 2022, and that's resulted in a pretty tremendous amount of insight across the board.

Sanger put out a few pieces of work which greatly expanded our interactome maps, which was also pretty amazing, summary here: [First map of immune system connections reveals new therapeutic opportunities](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/news_item/first-map-of-immune-system-connections-reveals-new-therapeutic-opportunities/).  While less obviously ""neuroscience"" for behaviorists, the underlying protein mechanics govern cellular interactions in a very broad way throughout the nervous system, and these interaction maps provide a pretty strong step toward a better understanding of the metabolic complexity we previously didn't really grasp.

"What was the most impactful Neuroscience article, discovery, or content of the year?",What makes it so impactful? What was special about it?,"Not so much an article but an idea... Geoff Hinton gave a keynote address during NeurIPS 2022 (a couple of weeks ago) about how the advancement of artificial intelligence lies in forward-forward processing. The difference between that and the usual back propagation technique is that another, separate process is used to improve learning in another forward process. This means the computational load on learning can be done in real time, rather than the computationally expensive task of back propagation. Some of these points were also highlighted by Jürgen Schmidhuber in his keynote during the same conference. 

How does this relate to neuroscience? Well, Geoff mentioned that a possible reason for why we sleep is to perform a similar forward-forward processing task in our brains to improve learning from the barrage of data we absorbed while awake. The reason why such a hypothesis is remarkable is because we are starting to uncover things about our own brains by optimising artificial intelligence, which we largely created with inspiration from our own brains.

Structural and functional properties of spinal dorsal horn neurons after peripheral nerve injury change overtime via astrocyte activation,,"**Summary**: Chronic pain remains challenging to treat, despite numerous reports of its pathogenesis, including neuronal plasticity in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH). We hypothesized that understanding plasticity only at a specific time point after peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is insufficient to solve chronic pain. 

Here, we analyzed the temporal changes in synaptic transmission and astrocyte-neuron interactions in SDH after PNI. We found that synaptic transmission in the SDH after PNI changed in a time-dependent manner, which was accompanied by astrocyte proliferation and loss of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. 

Furthermore, neuronal loss was accompanied by necroptosis. Short-term inhibition of astrocytes after PNI suppressed these physiological and morphological changes and long-term pain-related behaviors. 

These results are the first to demonstrate that the inhibition of astrocyte proliferation after PNI contributes to the long-term regulation of plasticity and of necroptosis development in the SDH.

**Discussion**:  IMO, this is a really cool piece of work!  My particular interest in this is it demonstrates one way astrocytes control and remodel not just the transmitter environment, but the mechanical properties of neurons themselves.  This type of behavior should be consistent for many types of nervous system function and provides more evidence for how critical glia are, particularly in contexts where perception and processing is involved.

Also, love the effect sizes in this work.  It's pretty uncommon to see such large effect sizes, and despite the risk of non-replication of the effect size, it indicates a much less ambiguous relationship between elements under observation.

Attractor and integrator networks in the brain,,"**Abstract**:

> In this Review, we describe the singular success of attractor neural network models in describing how the brain maintains persistent activity states for working memory, corrects errors and integrates noisy cues. We consider the mechanisms by which simple and forgetful units can organize to collectively generate dynamics on the long timescales required for such computations. We discuss the myriad potential uses of attractor dynamics for computation in the brain, and showcase notable examples of brain systems in which inherently low-dimensional continuous-attractor dynamics have been concretely and rigorously identified. Thus, it is now possible to conclusively state that the brain constructs and uses such systems for computation. Finally, we highlight recent theoretical advances in understanding how the fundamental trade-offs between robustness and capacity and between structure and flexibility can be overcome by reusing and recombining the same set of modular attractors for multiple functions, so they together produce representations that are structurally constrained and robust but exhibit high capacity and are flexible.

Learning-related contraction of grey matter in rodent sensorimotor cortex is associated with adaptive myelination,,"**Abstract**: From observations in rodents, it has been suggested that the cellular basis of learning-dependent changes, detected using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be increased dendritic spine density, alterations in astrocyte volume, and adaptations within intracortical myelin. 

Myelin plasticity is crucial for neurological function and active myelination is required for learning and memory. However, the dynamics of myelin plasticity and how it relates to morphometric-based measurements of structural plasticity remains unknown. 

We used a motor skill learning paradigm in male mice to evaluate experience-dependent brain plasticity by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in longitudinal MRI, combined with a cross-sectional immunohistochemical investigation. Whole brain VBM revealed non-linear decreases in grey matter volume (GMV) juxtaposed to non-linear increases in white matter volume (WMV) within GM that were best modelled by an asymptotic time course. 

Using an atlas-based cortical mask, we found non-linear changes with learning in primary and secondary motor areas and in somatosensory cortex. Analysis of cross-sectional myelin immunoreactivity in forelimb somatosensory cortex confirmed an increase in myelin immunoreactivity followed by a return towards baseline levels. 

Further investigations using quantitative confocal microscopy confirmed these changes specifically to the length density of myelinated axons. The absence of significant histological changes in cortical thickness suggests that non-linear morphometric changes are likely due to changes in intracortical myelin for which morphometric WMV in somatosensory cortex significantly correlated with myelin immunoreactivity. 

Together, these observations indicate a non-linear increase of intracortical myelin during learning and support the hypothesis that myelin is a component of structural changes observed by VBM during learning.

**Commentary**:  What an interesting piece of work!  One of the weirdest contradictions in current neuroscientific thought IMO is why there is such a disconnect between ""learning"" and brain volumes.  We have a mountain of heterogeneous data which supports assumptions in both directions, that learning adds and subtracts volume in specific regions depending on what the hypothesis of the study was.

Assumptions about ""neuro-plasticity"" and Hebbian mechanics suggest we should be able to image a brain and ascertain the level of stored information in a nervous system by both volume and synaptic density. And yet we can't, especially when we examine learning on a longitudinal basis.

This work offers an intriguing explanation of those mechanics, that on shorter timescales learning increases astrocytic volume until changes to neuronal circuits encode that information, after which the volume returns to metabolic homeostasis.  This work brings to mind the idea of a wire being stripped back, and the ends of the wire encoded with updated information, after which the wire is re-insulated.

Interestingly, recent work suggests [astrocytes undergo transient swelling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920309873) under learning tasks, and return to homeostasis (hopefully, long term inflammation is bad) after modifying the dendritic morphology of connected neurons.  Put together, this offers a coherent explanation for the overarching question of why we can't image ""learned"" brains, the information is ""condensed"" into a differential by astrocytes, which are wired into neurons, and re-myelinated.

From an entropy/energetics standpoint, this is a pretty ""clever"" efficiency mechanic.  Instead of needing to maintain an increasingly dense network of connections and the corresponding energy requirements to support it, nervous system energy needs do not change for this encode process.  Further, it dovetails with other recent work which suggests that [oligodendrocytes are not only required for learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04116-y), but that their [primary function is more metabolic](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11064-022-03771-1) than insulating.

One of the more difficult metaphors I've been working through is trying to express the relationship between glia as a whole and neurons in nervous systems.  Work like this brings to mind the relationship between bones, ligaments and muscles in an organism.  The conceit is that neurons work as bones, they provide structure and protection/persistence to the nervous system, while various glia work like muscles, tendons, and ligaments.

Anyway, this work provides a very interesting piece of contributing evidence toward unraveling one of the more perplexing *mysteries of neuroscience*.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9478377302487692

A question about TUS (Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation)," I'm a newcomer of brain science, and I'm sorry to ask this if it's a dumb question.

Since there's a lot of advantages of TUS(like deeper reachable distance, higher spatial resolution, do not disturb EEG measure), why it's not as popular as TMS?

Is there any fault of TUS? What's the main difficulty of develop such a system?","All of this is just my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.

The question of why tFUS doesn't have greater penetration compared to TMS is mostly a matter of maturity, TMS has been around ~40 years and has been FDA approved as a treatment for ~15.  

*Usually* the lead time between invention and having enough critical mass to get through the FDA approval process, particularly without a company spending heavy dollars to fund trial protocols, is significant.  Once FDA approval happens, insurance companies will start paying for it, and that leads to the snowball in penetration.

Ultrasound for nervous system stimulation appeared around ~23 years ago, so it's following a similar trajectory to TMS and we should see FDA approvals for it within the next decade.  The biggest hurdle behind both is that there really isn't any unique IP that makes it financially appealing to front the work necessary for faster approval.  

I forget who said it, however it's true of both of these techniques, that there's always a sense of urgency to use the newest drug before it meets the real world and stops working.  This is true for TMS, which showed nearly miraculous potential under [protocols like SAINT](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.20101429), but show much less efficacy in the real world with pretty significant longitudinal drop offs.  For all the lab magic of tFUS, I don't think there's a reason to think it won't suffer the same type of result.

We should still be moving ***as quickly as possible*** toward increasing penetration of focused ultrasound across a wide number of applications, particularly imaging, because materials scarcity is going to severely limit existing options if we don't have significant technological breakthroughs.  While tFUS won't be completely clear of this, we have a ton more flexibility in transducer construction which will delay issues for quite some time as well as making for smaller, less expensive, and more portable devices.

From my own personal experimentation, the biggest challenges I'm facing with tFUS are all related to software.  The variability of human bodies makes for pretty significant differences in signal management, and nearly every setup ends up being bespoke to the cohort.  The process right now is agonizingly time consuming to create an initial settings map, then we need to run it again each time to check and make adjustments between settings.  I think most labs are using other imaging methods like MRI to get a head start on the initial settings (things like skull thickness and density for example make a huge difference), but it's still a lot of work.

More fundamental than that however, is that we still have a fundamental misunderstanding of how nervous systems actually work.  Far too much of the science in this area is built on assumptions that are *really really* terrible, and supported by evidence that could very generously be described as ""heterogeneous"".  The quality of the data that we can extract using these tools is completely bound by our expectations of that data, and looking at the current landscape our expectations aren't anywhere near where they should be to get consistent results.",curiosity_in_advancements,NEGATIVE,0.9719838798046112

Is there any fault of TUS? What's the main difficulty of develop such a system?","TUS is great for spatial resolution when compared to TMS. It was found that low intensity pulsed ultrasound can stimulate cortical neurons without tissue damage or thermal damage ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627310003764?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627310003764?via%3Dihub)). The main issue is reach the deeper underlying stuctures, which requires more energy. TUS, being a technique using mechanical pressure, would cause thermal damage at those higher energy levels required for deep stimulation. 

There is a similar problem with TMS and TES in which the required stimulation intensity to reach the deeper sturctures can over-stimulate the overlying coritical areas, which might then result in unexpected outcomes & can reach safety limits. 

I would look into temporally interfering electric fields for deeper brain stimulation. I highly recommend checking out this paper by Grossman (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867417305846?via%3Dihub)",other,NEGATIVE,0.6537403464317322

"Scientists have proposed a new mechanistic model (AD2) for Alzheimer's, looking at it not as a brain disease, but as a chronic autoimmune condition that attacks the brain. (Perspective, Sep 2022) Alzheimer's disease as an innate autoimmune disease (AD2): A new molecular paradigm.",,"Sigh.

This model has exactly the same problem that plaque/tangle/body models do, there is very little correlation between clinical presentation and actual pathophysiology.  In nearly every large dementia related autopsy study I've seen, the ability to identify ""Alzheimer's"" and ""normally aging"" is nearly non-existent without clinical history.  This model looks ""good on paper"" for exactly the same reason plaque/tangle/body models did, because nearly every aged person exhibits these same pathophysiological markers.  

Describing something as an autoimmune disease without making a significant contribution toward identifying the mechanism through which it would have such specific effects is just more speculation based on the unproven.  It's exactly this kind of thinking which got us to this ""15 years later... nothing changed"" place.

I've seen very little compelling evidence that ""Alzheimer's"" is a discrete pathological condition, and quite a bit over the last few years which supports the argument that all of these psychiatry assessed dementias are likely an artifact of the same pathologies.  The evidence right now in my opinion much more strongly argues for glial metabolic dysfunction, which provides consistent mechanics for many of the risk factors.  

There was a popular line of thought about a decade ago which got drowned out by the plaque/tangle hype describing Alzheimer's as ""[diabetes type 3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12035-022-02846-y)"".  This theory is consistent with more recent work associating [astrocyte metabolic dysfunction](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cns.13982) with nearly all dementia types, including Huntington's and Parkinson's.

This model has the same problems as the plaques/tangles/bodies models and the work offered here provides less clarity than competing glial metabolic theories.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9995238780975342

I think this approach has more promise on how to treat dementias than it does as a mechanistic model of the brain disease. The author points to how Amyloid-B acts as a pathogen detector, but does not give a mechanistic approach into how it does it. For instance when beta-secretase cleaves Amyloid-B precursor protein then we should see higher increases in people with brain infections, but offers no sources that show this or how to test it. If this is an autoimmune disease then you should see it happening when it's supposed to during a *normal* brain infection. The reason why we see more immune activity, postmortem, in patients who had Alzheimer's is because their system is trying to clean up those damaged tangled proteins, but the system is overwhelmed. Also, their model doesn't say anything about genetic findings versus sporadic Alzheimer cases. Maybe a model can be made to help the immune system clean up those tangled proteins but I doubt it is an autoimmune disease.

"Divergent Cellular Energetics, Glutamate Metabolism, and Mitochondrial Function Between Human and Mouse Cerebral Cortex",,"**Abstract**: Disruptions of brain energy and neurotransmitter metabolism are associated with several pathological conditions including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. 

Transgenic rodent models, and in vitro preparations hereof, are often applied for studying pathological aspects of brain metabolism.  However, despite the conserved cerebral development across mammalian species, distinct differences in cellular composition and structure may influence metabolism of the rodent and human brain.  To address this, we investigated the metabolic function of acutely isolated brain slices and non-synaptic mitochondria obtained from the cerebral cortex of mice and neurosurgically resected neocortical tissue of humans. 

Utilizing dynamic isotope labeling with 13C-enriched metabolic substrates, we show that metabolism of glucose, acetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and glutamine operates at lower rates in human cerebral cortical slices when compared to mouse slices.  In contrast, human cerebral cortical slices display a higher capacity for converting exogenous glutamate into glutamine, which subsequently supports neuronal GABA synthesis, whereas mouse slices primarily convert glutamate into aspartate. 

In line with the reduced metabolic rate of the human brain slices, isolated non-synaptic mitochondria of the human cerebral cortex have a lower oxygen consumption rate when provided succinate as substrate. However, when provided pyruvate and malate, human mitochondria display a higher coupled respiration and lower proton leak, signifying a more efficient mitochondrial coupling compared to mouse mitochondria. 

This study reveals key differences between mouse and human brain metabolism concerning both neurons and astrocytes, which must be taken into account when applying in vitro rodent preparations as a model system of the human brain.

**Commentary**:  I think it's pretty well understood that animal models have significant deficiencies when directly applied to human function, however work to quantify those differences are lagging.  This work takes a look at one aspect of function which may not be obvious doing histological comparison between human and mouse models, illustrating a difference wide enough to explain many failures of translation between the two.  

Understanding differences like this will allow better normalization between models, greatly improving the quality and translation of animal work to human conditions.

That aside, it's also exciting to see discussion about the metabolic efficiency differences between species as metabolic insult research has been driving a significant amount of recent work into human conditions.  Work which provides a more granular understanding of metabolic function in nervous systems is (IMO) the most promising path forward to both understanding and resolving issues in many areas of research.

The role of astrocytes in behaviors related to emotion and motivation,,It's nice to see more and more research is about astrocytes.

The role of astrocytes in behaviors related to emotion and motivation,,"**Abstract**: Astrocytes are present throughout the brain and intimately interact with neurons and blood vessels. Three decades of research have shown that astrocytes reciprocally communicate with neurons and other non-neuronal cells in the brain and dynamically regulate cell function. 

Astrocytes express numerous receptors for neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and cytokines and receive information from neurons, other astrocytes, and other non-neuronal cells. Among those receptors, the main focus has been G-protein coupled receptors. Activation of G-protein coupled receptors leads to dramatic changes in intracellular signaling (Ca2+ and cAMP), which is considered a form of astrocyte activity. 

Methodological improvements in measurement and manipulation of astrocytes have advanced our understanding of the role of astrocytes in circuits and have begun to reveal unexpected functions of astrocytes in behavior. Recent studies have suggested that astrocytic activity regulates behavior flexibility, such as coping strategies for stress exposure, and plays an important role in behaviors related to emotion and motivation. 

Preclinical evidence suggests that impairment of astrocytic function contributes to psychiatric diseases, especially major depression. Here, we review recent progress on the role of astrocytes in behaviors related to emotion and motivation.

**Commentary**:  The last few years have brought about a tremendous increase in imaging resolution, which in turn has dramatically increased our understanding of how nervous system cells interact to generate behavior.  This article is a pretty good review of the increases in understanding around the function of glial cells, particularly astrocytes and their contribution to neurological function.

Disengaging spinal afferent nerve communication with the brain in live mice,,"I'm more than a little bothered by some of the decisions made in this paper and their implications for how this work may be received, especially given the title and tone of the press release link OP linked in the comments.

First, as a quick ground statement: DRG ligation and/or transection is a model of chronic neuropathic pain. If you cut a DRG either at the spinal or peripheral branch in a mouse, you will cause lasting cutaneous nociception and pain-like behaviors. This makes it all the more bewildering to me that patients with chronic pain will undergo surgery to sever DRG representing the dermatopic regions of their pain. It works in some, yes, but many others then come back to their anesthesiologist or surgeon with worsened or persistent pain, and we have no way of predicting which response a patient will have at this time.

""But [REDACTED], they looked at limb response to potentially noxious stimuli following these transections and didn't see any heightened response (Figure 6)."" Well, sort of, but realistically the behavioral test and *output* measured is not sufficient to claim that animals undergoing these surgeries did not have cutaneous pain or hypersensitivity as a complication. The authors' pain-behavior of choice is a visceromotor response, which, for the record, is absolutely appropriate for assessing visceral pain. In this set up, you surgically implant electrodes along the abdomen to measure reflex evoked by a stimulus, usually an inflatable balloon fed up to either the bladder (male rodent) or vagina (female rodent). When you reach a pressure threshold, the animal contracts its abdomen, and the electrodes evoke that response. Indeed, when you remove the neuronal connection between the viscera and the spinal cord, noxious visceral stimuli do not evoke an abdominal reflex. However, you cannot say that because a peripheral noxious stimulus (eg. hind- or fore-limb pinch) does not evoke *an abdominal reflex*, that the transection of those DRG do not sensitize the peripheral limb to noxious stimuli. In other words, this study is completely disregarding the impact of their surgery model on pain-like behaviors in non-visceral organs, and their claim that ""it is now possible to selectively ablate DRG of interest at specific spinal segments... without incurring physiological deficits to other organs"" *is not properly supported*. It is also concerning that this is being lauded in the press release and interview as a potential therapy without discussion or consideration for the known and documented possibility of worsening a patient's pain.

All of that said, there's some good stuff here from a research tool perspective, which I'm willing to bet is more in line with what the authors intended for this work. First, they did show that removing some of the sensory afferents to the viscera largely preserves function (note: some sensory function in the areas denervated by DRG ligation will be present due to vagal afferents). This was honestly a little surprising to me, as dysregulation of these afferents following injury or inflammatory insult (which should be present on axonal ligation) affects colonic motility in some models, but the data here are sound.

It is also good that the denervation of the gut following DRG transection is localized. Usually, when you look at skin or muscle sensory innervation following DRG transection, there are changes in innervation in neighboring derma- and myo-tomes (eg, regions next to those innervated by the affected DRG). It is really interesting that the authors don't see the same pattern in visceral innervation, and I wonder what that tells us as a field about the differing roles of the end-organ in the denervation process.

&#x200B;

Ultimately, I think this is a solid paper and it introduces/characterizes a tool for visceral pain research.

A CRISPRi/a platform in human iPSC-derived microglia uncovers regulators of disease states,,"Abstract

Microglia are emerging as key drivers of neurological diseases. However, we lack a systematic understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here, we present a screening platform to systematically elucidate functional consequences of genetic perturbations in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia. We developed an efficient 8-day protocol for the generation of microglia-like cells based on the inducible expression of six transcription factors. We established inducible CRISPR interference and activation in this system and conducted three screens targeting the 'druggable genome'. These screens uncovered genes controlling microglia survival, activation and phagocytosis, including neurodegeneration-associated genes. A screen with single-cell RNA sequencing as the readout revealed that these microglia adopt a spectrum of states mirroring those observed in human brains and identified regulators of these states.

Recent advances in RNA structurome,,"**Abstract**: RNA structures are essential to support RNA functions and regulation in various biological processes. Recently, a range of novel
technologies have been developed to decode genome-wide RNA structures and novel modes of functionality across a wide range
of species. 

In this review, we summarize key strategies for probing the RNA structurome and discuss the pros and cons of representative technologies. In particular, these new technologies have been applied to dissect the structural landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. 

We also summarize the functionalities of RNA structures discovered in different regulatory layers including RNA processing, transport, localization, and mRNA translation across viruses, bacteria, animals, and plants. We review many versatile RNA structural elements in the context of different physiological and pathological processes (e.g., cell differentiation, stress response, and viral replication). 

Finally, we discuss future prospects for RNA structural studies to map the
RNA structurome at higher resolution and at the single-molecule and single-cell level, and to decipher novel modes of RNA structures and functions for innovative applications.

**Commentary**:  The last few years have been moving extremely fast with regard to understanding the histological mechanics of how nervous systems process information.  Traditional models have relied on concepts like ""neurotransmitters"" as an explanation of how information processing occurs, instead the most recent evidence suggests that actual information is processed at the genetic level through RNA mediated peptide exchange.  Better understanding of the mechanics of these RNA mediated exchanges should open up a tremendous amount of advances across our understanding of nervous system function.

This review is an excellent look at the current state of technologies being employed in this pursuit, including a good pros/cons reference for each technology.

Change optimization function for dipole fitting in Fieldtrip MATLAB," 

Hello neuroscience enthusiasts,

&#x200B;

I am new to MATLAB coding and I am currently working on dipole optimization problem and using the MATLAB code from fieldtrip to optimize the goodness of fit of my dipole function. The fieldtrip uses either fminsearch or fminunc for the dipole optimization method

&#x200B;

\[param, fval, exitflag, output\] = optimfun(@dipfit\_error, param, options, dat, sens, headmodel, constr, metric, checkinside, mleweight, reducerank, normalize, normalizeparam, weight, backproject); where optimfun is either  @   fminsearch or @  fminunc.

I want to apply simulated annealing algorithm for my optimization function, but I am not quite familiar with the arguments that it takes. Can I set lb=\[\], ub=\[\] and apply simulated annealing to the above function and calculate goodness of fit for my function? What should be the order of the input arguments if I use Simulated annealing?

Will this work? 

\[param, fval, exitflag, output\] =@simulannealbnd(@dipfit\_error, param,lb=\[\],ub=\[\], options, dat, sens, headmodel, constr, metric, checkinside, mleweight, reducerank, normalize, normalizeparam, weight, backproject);

&#x200B;

or will changing the optimization function completely disrupt the program flow?

For specific commentary, any model which relies on neurons as the central units of information processing in nervous systems is inconsistent with current evidence.  Glia control not only the metabolics of information processing, they also drive the peptide signalling process which governs the actual genetic expression which enables it.  By viewing the nervous system as ""neurons and some other cells"" instead of a system of cells which coordinate information processing (at the very least to tripartite synapse level participation), the model misses a tremendous amount of necessary information to be predictive.

Have there been any attempts of altering the myelin of oligodendrocyte coverings in the brain so that they can create reparative tunnels like Schwann cells elsewhere in the body?,"The axons of the brain and spinal cord, unfortunately, lack this feature which is found elsewhere in the body. It allows for severed limbs and extremities to be reattached and would be of great use for traumatic injuries to the brain/spinal cord.

Peripheral neurons have, technically, less complex connections between one another than do neurons in the brain. The PNS largely consists of Efferent and Afferent connections to and from the spinal cord with long axons. In the CNS, however, the connections are substantially more complex and intricate in terms of signaling. If they are repaired, but their connections are incorrect, you can cause short circuits that could lead to seizures or other forms of maladies.

I think also the CNS, especially the brain, doesn't usually deal with damages that cause simple severance of axons. Typically damage to the CNS are due to traumatic injury, which can crush the soma of neurons leading to their deaths, or with issues such as hemorrhages or ischemic strokes. Either way, injuries to the CNS are, as far as I know and I could be wrong, usually injure neurons in ways that kill them or their supporting glia cells.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9868354797363281

Drosophila auditory connectome - 3D animation of cells from recent Current Biology paper,,"A new paper was published by our lab recently in Current Biology that features the first auditory connectome of any species and includes the discovery of 24 new types of neurons.

Male flies sing two types of “songs” in courtship: either a sine or pulse, and they switch between these modes in order to attract a female mate. The female moves closer to the male when she likes the tune, so the male adjusts what he sings accordingly. This is a pretty complicated behavior for such a small animal! The FlyWire FAFB dataset is a female (FAFB = full adult female fly brain), so researchers studied how she understands what she hears and interprets song into action (do I like this and move closer or nah, move back?). They found distinct groups of neurons that prefer either sine, pulse, or a combination of courtship songs. This is reminiscent of how retinal ganglion cells in Eyewire have a ‘preferred direction” of motion – these auditory neurons seem to have a preferred tune! By analyzing the network, Baker et al (Murthy and Seung Labs, Princeton) found that they could predict the response of neurons and that the organization of the network is nonhierarchical.

So, neurons communicate with eachother by one neuron emitting an action potential, then when the electrical signal reaches the synapse, a PSP is emitted and this determines whether the signal is passed on again from the other neuron and so on.

Threshold potential for dendritic action potentials vs axonal: greater or smaller?,,"Guess you are asking whether the \*local\* voltage threshold for spike initiation within the dendrites is higher than for axonal spikes? Voltage-gated sodium channels respond to voltage changes similarly regardless of whether they are located in the dendrites or elsewhere. So the threshold for dendritic spiking would depend on factors like local concentration of voltage-gated channels and how easily a voltage change in a different part of cell gets conducted to the dendrites (i.e., the efficacy of backpropagation), which depends on the morphology and local electrical and chemical properties. These factors are generally quite variable across different neurons so anything is possible, but on average it seems to be the case that you need stronger input for dendritic spiking than axonal (e.g., the axon hillocks have much higher concentration of voltage-gated channels).

2. Also take time to consider what type of control will be implemented. How will you ensure that any outcome measure change is not simply a result of practice/training and can be directly attributed to the neurofeedback.

I fully support further research into EEG Neurofeedback, but please be aware that it most certainly is not viewed as a respected or effective neuromodulation option among the broader community. Feel free to reply here or PM if you have further questions. Good luck!",other,NEGATIVE,0.813269853591919

"How does the brain assign a ""probability"" to a set of sensory inputs?","**Edit**: Thanks all for your replies! I omitted latent variable models in my original post, which was clearly an oversight on my part since that seems to be the dominant framing by neuroscientists. I actually think the recent success of [diffusion models](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/) for image generation lends a lot of support to this viewpoint, since interpreting them through a [variational lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00630) means you can fairly efficiently estimate an evidence lower bound for an input (i.e., you don't need to sample), which can be used as an approximation of the likelihood/probability.

I tried googling for answers but I wasn't able to find anything (maybe I don't know the right jargon?). For the sake of simplicity and analogizing to machine learning (my domain), let's just focus on images where I'll refer to a full ""image"" (i.e., visual input from the eyes) as x and an individual ""pixel"" as x_i. How do neuroscientists think the brain calculates p(x|previous brain state), which I'm assuming it's doing since we can be surprised? I'm interested in both physiological mechanisms and theories, and I'm specifically interested in discussions around testing these alternatives:

1) No independence assumptions and the pixels are processed in a fixed order: i.e., p(x) = p(x_1) * p(x_2|x_1) * p(x_3|x_2, x_1). This chain rule factorization is how large language models like GPT-3 are designed, but the challenge with images is that they are much larger dimensionally than even long text inputs, and this issue is exacerbated further with the human visual system. 

**Specific questions here**: Can the brain process inputs in a repeatable order? Does the brain compute something like a chain rule factorization?

2) No independence assumptions and order-agnostic, i.e., p(x) = p(x_1) * p(x_2|x_1) * p(x_3|x_2, x_1), but the brain can also compute, e.g., p(x) = p(x_3) * p(x_2|x_3) * p(x_1|x_2, x_3). This is related to [my own research on order-agnostic distribution estimation](https://github.com/airalcorn2/deformer) and is what got me thinking about these questions. It seems more biologically plausible to me that inputs would be processed in varying orders since the brain is a slightly imprecise analog medium.

3) No independence assumptions, but the probability is calculated on y = f(x) where f is visual preprocessing that reduces the dimensionality of x.

**Specific questions here**: How is this preprocessing function acquired? Is it learned? Or is it the result of natural selection?

4) Independence assumptions where the most extreme case is p(x) = p(x_1) * p(x_2) * p(x_3). This is essentially a null hypothesis since it seems unlikely the brain is doing this, but how do neuroscientists actually test this? I'm guessing there are information theoretic ways.

Not sure what the answer is as to how the brain has learned or is imbued with this function but there is a lot of research now into the cerebellum as holding a mental model of the world and generating prediction errors.

Brain detects features (such as lines, corners, angles, speed, etc.) and then constellation of features create objects. It actually uses two separte pathways for visual analysis: Ventral and Dorsal. The ventral detects objects and the dorsal does the spatial analysis. So when we look at a scene we break it into objects and their positions and relationships. As long as the changes in the visual input doesn't significantly change those parameters, then you might not even notice them, e.g. ""change blindness"".  Then the question is how brain decides the presence of objects? Which is probably the better question and as others have pointed out depends on brain expectation and predictive powers and probably self-organized nets such as Hopfield models also are helpful. We don't just input info, brain continuously makes predictions and fills in the blanks (why we don't see the blind-spot) using the priors and posteriors, which is close to something like bayesian as others have pointed out.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9896472096443176

`NiChord` was originally designed for use with fMRI functional connectivity data (“FPCN”, “DMN”, etc. in the examples are names of [brain networks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulcbogdan/NiChord/main/example/ex_1_and_2.png)). However, in principle, NiChord can be used with any type of data.

The chord diagrams are made from scratch by plotting shapes and lines in `matplotlib`. The diagrams are meant to be rather minimalist relative to [typical chord diagrams](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/chord.html).

Though it seems to have suffered from a food effect which lead to a varying bioavailability. 

Hopefully future studies on VX-548 are positive as well as it would further validate the protein's importance for pain of peripheral origin. Small molecule drugs have significant limitation to their selectivity which is likely one of the reasons it has been so hard to develop selective sodium channel blockers. Hopefully validating these ion channels as possible targets for peripheral analgesia will lead to even more potent painkillers once newer technologies targeting gene expression can come into use.

A physical wiring diagram for the human immune system,,"**Abstract**: The human immune system is composed of a distributed network of cells circulating throughout the body, which must dynamically form physical associations and communicate using interactions between their cell-surface proteomes.

Despite their therapeutic potential, our map of these surface interactions remains incomplete. Here, using a high-throughput surface receptor screening method, we systematically mapped the direct protein interactions across a recombinant library that encompasses most of the surface proteins that are detectable on human leukocytes.

We independently validated and determined the biophysical parameters of each novel interaction, resulting in a high-confidence and quantitative view of the receptor wiring that connects human immune cells.

By integrating our interactome with expression data, we identified trends in the dynamics of immune interactions and constructed a reductionist mathematical model that predicts cellular connectivity from basic principles.

We also developed an interactive multi-tissue single-cell atlas that infers immune interactions throughout the body, revealing potential functional contexts for new interactions and hubs in multicellular networks.

Finally, we combined targeted protein stimulation of human leukocytes with multiplex high-content microscopy to link our receptor interactions to functional roles, in terms of both modulating immune responses and maintaining normal patterns of intercellular associations.

Together, our work provides a systematic perspective on the intercellular wiring of the human immune system that extends from systems-level principles of immune cell connectivity down to mechanistic characterization of individual receptors, which could offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

**Commentary**: This feels like the end of the world as we know it, within this decade we may have a complete map of cellular interactions across the entire range of genetic expression.   Work like this feels like it has the potential to change everything.  Great work from Sanger (as usual).

We carried out extensive characterizations of tau isoforms expressed in human neurons derived by microRNA-induced neuronal reprogramming of adult fibroblasts. Transcript and protein analyses showed that miR neurons expressed all six isoforms with the 3R:4R isoform ratio equivalent to that detected in human adult brains. Also, miR neurons derived from familial tauopathy patients with a 3R:4R ratio altering mutation showed increased 4R tau and the formation of insoluble tau with seeding activity.

Differences in learning abilities regarding individuals; what are different people capable of?,"

Is this true? Is there any evidence anyone can give me which confirms this? There are people who work incredibly hard, but only scrape passes in GCSE subjects, for example. Yet there are those who say that hard work always pays off, but this is surely wrong, as it would not have the same effect on all people. 

There are many people online who claim they were failing “X” but then worked hard and succeeded in “X”, yet there are several examples of individuals I have read about who say that their hard work did not pay off; at least not in the way they expected.

Research by Oxford university ( https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2019-05-29-children-similar-cognitive-ability-have-very-different-chances-educational-success) has shown that many disadvantaged students do not achieve their maximum potential. 

Research by AZO life sciences has shown that for people who were genetically predisposed to academic success, of those who came from a poorer background, only 47 percent made it to university. From Oxford university:

Individuals with high levels of cognitive ability but who are disadvantaged in their social origins are persistently unable to translate their ability into educational attainment to the same extent as their more advantaged counterparts.

This would surely mean, then, that despite these people’s high potential, they would consider themselves incapable.
Furthermore, this means many students are unable to achieve their full potential. However, this differs between individuals.
Data from PotentialPlusUK says 60 percent of students achieve their maximum academic potential; yet 60 percent of students do not gain the highest grades. Does this mean that there are differences in maximum academic potentials between individuals? People often ask the question regarding whether people of average intelligence can gain top grades by just hard work. Some of these people do; however there is a catch. They have also proven they have a high potential to learn and understand; more so than the average person (hence are not average). Rather, these people have worked hard, yes, but reached their maximum potential as well (which differs from person to person). 
Is this correct, given that differences in potential exist? Many people do work hard, but they get lower grades than those who put in the same effort.

Essentially, wherever your starting point was, if you have managed to say, gain a PHD in Physics or all A*s at GCSE/A level you have proven that you have a high academic potential to learn and understand material (which subsequently means that considering yourself average would be a fallacy; having only average potential to learn and understand); further supported as differences in potentials exist between people. Essentially, they’ve proven their own potential as being high, but given that differences in potential exist, what does this mean for everyone?

Also, are there genetic limits to each person’s maximum academic potential?

Could anyone who knows more about this or perhaps specialises in the field please expand or comment on this? Thank you.","I absolutely love this thought process.

Tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for human cortical astrocytes,,"**Significance**: Neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms occur in as many as one-third of patients with or recovering from COVID-19. To address severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neural tropism, we evaluated the vulnerability of primary developing and adult cortical tissue and stem-cell-derived cortical organoids to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 

We observe robust infection and viral replication in human cortical astrocytes; they become reactive, have increased growth factor signaling, and activate cellular stress. Despite infection in astroglial cells, there is minimal infection of other neural cell types, including neurons. 

Surprisingly, we discover that astrocyte infection is unlikely to be mediated by the predominant coronavirus receptor, ACE2, and instead observe alternative glycoproteins, CD147 and DPP4, expressed on astrocytes; they are necessary and sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

**Commentary**: Astrocytes sit at the intersection of cognition and immune function in the brain.  A virus that preferentially targets them can result in long lasting neurological damage even after the virus has been cleared.",other,NEGATIVE,0.942097008228302

""The chemical imbalance theory of depression is still put forward by professionals \[17\], and the serotonin theory, in particular, has formed the basis of a considerable research effort over the last few decades \[14\]. The general public widely believes that depression has been convincingly demonstrated to be the result of serotonin or other chemical abnormalities \[15, 16\], and this belief shapes how people understand their moods, leading to a pessimistic outlook on the outcome of depression and negative expectancies about the possibility of self-regulation of mood \[64,65,66\]. The idea that depression is the result of a chemical imbalance also influences decisions about whether to take or continue antidepressant medication and may discourage people from discontinuing treatment, potentially leading to lifelong dependence on these drugs \[67, 68\].""",other,POSITIVE,0.6420286893844604

"Soft, stretchable, fully implantable miniaturized optoelectronic systems for wireless optogenetics",,"
>Abstract:
Optogenetics allows rapid, temporally specific control of neuronal activity via targeted expression and activation of light-sensitive proteins. Implementation typically requires remote light sources and fiber-optic delivery schemes that impose significant physical constraints on natural behaviors. In this report we bypass these limitations using novel technologies that combine thin, mechanically soft neural interfaces with fully implantable, stretchable wireless radio power and control systems. The resulting devices achieve optogenetic modulation of the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. This is demonstrated with two form factors; stretchable film appliques that interface directly with peripheral nerves, and flexible filaments that insert into the narrow confines of the spinal epidural space. These soft, thin devices are minimally invasive, and histological tests suggest they can be used in chronic studies. We demonstrate the power of this technology by modulating peripheral and spinal pain circuitry, providing evidence for the potential widespread use of these devices in research and future clinical applications of optogenetics outside the brain.",other,POSITIVE,0.9238252639770508

Human Studies of Transcranial Ultrasound neuromodulation: A systematic review of effectiveness and safety,,">Abstract  
>  
>Background  
>  
>Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is gaining traction as a safe and non-invasive technique in human studies. There has been a rapid increase in TUS human studies in recent years, with more than half of studies to date published after 2020. This rapid growth in the relevant body of literature necessitates comprehensive reviews to update clinicians and researchers.  
>  
>Objective  
>  
>The aim of this work is to review human studies with an emphasis on TUS devices, sonication parameters, outcome measures, results, and adverse effects, as well as highlight future directions of investigation.  
>  
>Methods  
>  
>A systematic review was conducted by searching the Web of Science and PubMed databases on January 12, 2022. Human studies of TUS were included.  
>  
>Results  
>  
>A total of 35 studies were identified using focused/unfocused ultrasound devices. A total of 677 subjects belonging to diverse cohorts (i.e., healthy, chronic pain, dementia, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, depression) were enrolled. The stimulation effects vary in a sonication parameter-dependant fashion. Clinical, neurophysiological, radiological and histological outcome measures were assessed. No severe adverse effects were reported in any of the studies surveyed. Mild symptoms were observed in 3.4% (14/425) of the subjects, including headache, mood deterioration, scalp heating, cognitive problems, neck pain, muscle twitches, anxiety, sleepiness and pruritis.  
>  
>Conclusions  
>  
>Although increasingly being used, TUS is still in its early phases. TUS can change short-term brain excitability and connectivity, induce long-term plasticity, and modulate behavior. New techniques should be used to further elucidate its underlying mechanisms and identify its application in novel populations.",other,NEGATIVE,0.8035123348236084

Thanks!","Neurophysiology PhD here, which probably makes me least qualified because I’m too specialized. I think it’s important to keep in mind that there are many roads to any individual behavior or affective state (i.e. depression/mania) so it depends on the individual. As others mention, much of this is programmed differently for each of us, in part, due to genetic and epigenetic developmental factors. This is why there is no magic bullet psychiatric drug for everyone. 

Dopamine and serotonin are slow neurotransmitters so they will help set the global tone of an emotional state, but the primary drivers of neural response is going to be the balance of GABAergic and glutamatergic (fast acting NTs) inputs/outputs. As others have mentioned, this will result in the over or under activity of the brain. While feelings are part of DSM checklists, output is a large component (excessive spending or social avoidance/inactivity). With these, humans label conditions, but they’re all spectral and don’t identify any neural pathways as a diagnosis. This is getting others’ responses of agitation vs mania.

One of my old mentors, Jaak Panksepp the father of Affective Neuroscience, has two books on the neural pathways and mechanisms of emotion. Archeology of the Mind is the one written for more general audiences. His life work was mapping pathways of emotional systems. I would suggest a more specialized book than Kandel and Schwartz. They have some content on this, but it’s more of an extended intro to neuroscience with too much focus on detailed neural mechanisms not applicable to your question. You’d be purchasing an expensive book with thousands of pages and (although I haven’t opened it in years) probably only has one or two short chapters on the subject. This isn’t their specialized area of expertise. If you get a book find something cheaper and shorter with more content on affect. The Kandel and Schwartz is good, but more of a catch all go to for neuroscience students.

Also, the inflammation theories are indeed prevailing as a component of schizophrenia, potentially by disinhibition of thalamic pathways that gate sensory information filtering. Similar theories for why hallucinations occur. Just keep in mind these are theories as contributors, not absolutes on exactly why emotional and behavioral responses occur.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9985993504524231

Brain wiring resources,"Hello everyone, is there a resource you go to for brain wiring?

I am specifically looking for an online tool that can describe/show information loops within the Basal Ganglia for example or communication between Basal Ganglia and Frontal cortex in a 3D manner. There is obviously insane amounts of information on brain wiring but I can never find a succinct account at the resolution I am looking for, anatomical atlases are too detailed and hard to conceptualize in 3D and papers are often not detailed enough.

Also, does anyone have good bird level overviews of information processing in the brain, starting from afferent sensory signals to efferent motor commands. I know this is a an active research topic but I am still looking for some generalizations and organizing principles.

Multi-frequency band EEG-based functional network models for psychiatric disorders,,"Great and important topic to study but i have some comments.

Seemingly they used real valued filtering and i guess hilbert transformation to get the phase estimates. This can very easily break the hilbert assumptions, leading to poor and biased phase estimates. Wavelets are the way to go.

In the slide they mention that source modeling solves the volume conduction problem. This is so far from the truth, it alleviates it but nowhere near solved.

They use PLV which is the absolute of the mean phase difference. PLV is borked here. The residual mixing inflates the PLV values. In anything MEEG, one has to use a metric insensitive to zero lag mixing (e.g. iPLV, wPLI, etc.). And even with those you have spurious mixing left!!! If these ghost interactions are not handled properly, graph theoretical approaches are biased and inflated.

Parametric statistics.

"Exactly how is DAT different in diseases like Parkinson, ADHD, Schizophrenia, etc.?","I have a hard time understanding this from papers. For example, in Parkinson, do we simply have fewer DATs or do they somehow look different?","EDIT: Someone made me aware you’re possibly talking about a DATscan. So that molecule is attracted to dopamine transporters so it will bind to dopamine transporters and show you where they’re located and relative quantities. Now like I mentioned in my initial response, DAT is going to decrease in quantity if you have less dopamine in those regions. So lower DATscan binding suggests that region is producing less dopamine. If you look at someone with PD, those dopamine producing neurons are dying, so that’s why there’s lower DAT expression. Higher would indicate the opposite. Some people with SCZ will have higher binding, but it’s not a diagnostic criteria and not everyone will experience that. 



I’m kind of confused by the question. So what I’m assuming you’re talking about given the diseases you’ve mentioned is the dopamine transporter DAT. But it’s not DAT that’s the issue. For diseases like Parkinson’s, it’s the death of neurons who produce dopamine, not the transporter. Then for things like schizophrenia they notice antipsychotics treat the symptoms, though the cause is thought to be more linked to abnormalities within the circuitry of certain regions (like the hippocampus) which can certainly affect dopamine signaling. Schizophrenia is highly complex, so to assume dopamine is the only thing at play would be incorrect. That’s like assuming serotonin causes depression because SSRI’s work to treat it in some cases. So schizophrenia likely has abnormal dopamine signaling, but so much more going on. 

Now logically, if a region has less dopamine to need to be transported it makes sense that DAT would decrease in expression, but that would be more of a side effect of the main effect. But I will mention DAT is not the only way to transport dopamine, and in many regions like the cerebral cortex it’s not even the main mechanism, COMT is. Issues with the monoamine transporters like DAT or COMT are usually genetic ones, where certain variants are more functional than others, or full mutations to the gene. Making these transporters more associated with genetic vulnerability to substance abuse than PD or SZ.",other,NEGATIVE,0.9993175268173218

Food for thought. How did neuroimaging techniques like fMRI and PET even begin to be developed?,"I sparked this discussion in a lab meeting yesterday, but does anyone know how people started even developing these techniques? Like, who thought, let me poke the brain this way and record it this way to see how it works? Where did these concepts even start? I ask this in response to how we don't currently have all the solutions and techniques to research our questions like how neural networks are integrated or if we can find a way to pick up individual neuronal activity as opposed to making inferences off of BOLD info. Currently, most of the techniques used to get the extremely detailed results are very invasive. This poses the problem that because it's invasive, we have to perfect the technique on animals first, but then there's also the factor that the animal's brain is significantly different than the humans so we really can't just hope the findings translate over. 

I feel like this first paragraph doesn't make too much sense, but I'm trying to visualize a future plan where we can work on developing neuroimaging or recording techniques that aren't as invasive as single cell electrode recording or injecting dye into a part of the brain and seeing what it does. I know science is a lot of ""if I do this, I wonder what will happen"", but that makes me think, can we find a way to manipulate neuronal activity without being as invasive as, lets say, a daily ssri that inhibits neurotransmitter activity but doesn't solely target that one aspect of the body and can affect other parts we didn't mean to bother. we weight the costs and benefits.

This amount of detail could also prevent unwanted side effects like digestive problems or libido changes. Like, why should the rest of my body suffer at the cost of me not having depressive thoughts?

How does laser hair removal not decrease sensation?,"To my understanding, 2 point discrimination and sensation in the skin is cause by various combinations of mechanoreceptors being opened by stimuli on the skin.

Please correct me if I'm wrong but from my understanding; guard , zigzag, and awl/auchene are connected to Merkel cells and Abeta, Agamma, and C low threshold mechanoreceptors and stimulation causes a distinct combination of mechanoreceptors to open and allow an influx of sodium ions thus causing the sensory afferent neurone to send a distinct combination of action potential which allow the brain to discern different types of stimulation on the skin (i.e vibration, something soft, something slippery etc. (but not the temperature of things which is recorded by thermoreceptors)).

I do not have laser hair surgery but I was doing research and most of the sources reported that there would not be a loss in sensation or that much pain (I know pain is conveyed by nociceptors not LTMRs but I included it to be able to paint a more accurate picture).

I want to understand *how it is possible to remove the hairs, which are connected to the mechanoreceptors that give rise to sensation in the skin in non glabrous areas, without causing a complete loss of sensation, or even just a slight to significant decrease in sensation.*

Additionally, In some areas of the body ""[\[women's skin\] has twice as many nerve fibers as men's skin](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjuzqaSrPz3AhWjoFwKHWZEA6EQFnoECAwQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webmd.com%2Fpain-management%2Fnews%2F20051028%2Fwomen-may-feel-pain-more-intensely-than-men&usg=AOvVaw1iYY-HCc8kUZH9SXnhPzsm)"", which causes [increased sensitivity to touch](https://www.psychmechanics.com/women-sensitive-to-touch/), especially in erogenous zones such as the inside of the thigh, or the ears.

edit : but if the hair follicle dies, it’s possible that the nearby LTMRs die too, leaving just the nociceptors",other,NEGATIVE,0.955469012260437
