EU regulator rejects Alzheimer's drug lecanemab,,"""The European Medicines Agency (EMA) did reject the marketing authorization for lecanemab, citing concerns about the robustness of the evidence and the clinical relevance of the benefits observed.""

""Lecanemab has shown some effectiveness in clinical trials, particularly in slowing cognitive decline in patients with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease. In a Phase 3 clinical trial, patients treated with lecanemab experienced a 27% reduction in cognitive decline compared to those receiving a placebo over 18 months. This is a significant finding, but it’s important to note that the drug does not stop or reverse the disease.""",interest_in_research,POSITIVE,0.9211415648460388,"Hello!

Advice for finding a postdoc that does not involve animal models when my grad work used mice,"Hi everyone, I am in a PhD program for neuroscience and will be defending in the next few months. All of my research experience has been with rats and mice. However, I am now severely allergic to mice and rats. I also just emotionally struggle with euthanizing. So for my postdoc, I want to either do research with humans, cell culture, or another organism like C. Elegans.

Has anyone here who studies neuro ever done this transition? If so, how did you do it? For instance, many of the postdocs studying human neuroscience require fMRI. Would it be possible for someone to do a postdoc in fMRI if they had no prior experience?

TLDR How do I get into non-animal-based neuro research if my background has been with rodent models?

Thanks everyone!","I always always use human subjects. People are excited to volunteer. All current research tech of any use is non invasive. The human neurological network is unique unto itself in complexity. There are no direct parallels to be drawn between animal and human neural networks, other than that all neurological anything is input/output.

I would suggest, finding people. I have never struggled with this. I am often a test subject myself. I think it's fun. The taboos about human testing are from other disciplines. Neuroscience is a blast to test. It is completely and totally ethical.",interest_in_research,POSITIVE,0.9976837635040284,"Hi there! It's great to see your passion for neuroscience.

"In experiments in mice, the most anxious individuals sought out stimulation of certain neurons that both induce extreme hunger and quiet anxiety. The findings suggest a biological basis for restricting food to the point of starvation, seeking anorexia-like behaviors to relieve stress.",,"I don't think anything about human neuroscience can be gleaned from studying mice. Neurological networks between individualist mice and collectivist humans differ spectacularly. Human subjects! I tell this to everyone studying animal neurology, the human brain is unique and incomparable. You should study humans. Especially because humans are more than willing to participate in these non invasive studies, I see no reason to opt lower. I really, passionately encourage researchers to use human subjects. It is harmless.

Unless you want to ""map"" mice for mouse studies of course, which is totally valid.",interest_in_research,POSITIVE,0.981009006500244,"Greetings!

I am soon graduating with a BSc in Neuroscience in the UK. I am planning to continue with a masters (just waiting for some unis to get back to me). I want to pursue cognitive science and have also been applying to a few research assistant jobs, but I noticed that a lot of them required past experience in recruiting/ working with participants. 

Does anyone have any advice as to where I could get such experience as a recently graduated BSc student? I have research experience in both wet (researching the BBB) and dry labs and narrative literature research. However, I lack the experience of working with research participants, or cognitive research in general. 

Also, if anyone knows of any type of neuro/ psychology experience in general, it would be great to hear about them! I think experience is really valuable and will definitely help me sharpen my skills.

Thankyou in advance!",interest_in_research,POSITIVE,0.9757784008979796,"Hello! We saw your interest in neuroscience, and if you're open to exploring it further, there are studies you could be part of that delve into fascinating questions. Let us know if you'd like details!"
Modulating the activity of human nociceptors with a SCN10A-promoter specific viral vector tool,,"AAV is a great vector for Neuroscience. Our lab uses it more as a research tool, but there's obviously a huge gene therapy potential as well. There are AAV treatments for parkinson's (which I believe utilize direct injections into the striatum, putamen, and substantia nigra) that are in clinical trials now. And AAV9 has been shown to cross the BBB due to its unique capsid structure. 

Also a very intelligent use of DREADDS.",interest_in_research,POSITIVE,0.9431579113006592,"Hi! It’s inspiring to see your engagement with neuroscience topics. If participating in related research appeals to you, we’d be delighted to share how you can contribute. Feel free to ask for more info!"
